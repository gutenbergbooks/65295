<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The subject of <span class="smcap">Scatalogic</span> or <span class="smcap">Stercoraceous Rites and
Practices</span>, however repellent it may be under some of its
aspects, is none the less deserving of the profoundest consideration,—if
for no other reason than that from the former universal
dissemination of such aberrations of the intellect, as well as of the
religious impulses of the human race, and their present curtailment
or restriction, the progress of humanity upward and onward
may best be measured.</p>

<p>Philosophical and erudite thinkers of past ages have published
tomes of greater or less magnitude upon this subject; among
these authors, it may be sufficient, at this moment, to mention
Schurig, Etmuller, Flemming, Paullini, Beckherius, Rosinus Lentilius,
and Levinus Lemnius. The historian Buckle regarded the
subject as one well worthy of examination and study, as will
appear in the text from the memoranda found in his scrap-books
after his death.</p>

<p>The philosopher Boyle is credited with the paternity of a
work which appeared over the signature “B,” bearing upon the
same topic.</p>

<p>The anonymous author or authors of the very learned pamphlet
“Bibliotheca Scatalogica,” for the perusal of which I am indebted
to the courtesy of Surgeon John S. Billings, collected a mass of
most valuable bibliographical references.</p>

<p>Quite recently there have appeared in the “Mitterlungen
Gesselsch.,” Wien, 1888, two pages of the work of Dr. M. Hofler,
“Volksmedicin und Aberglaube in Oberbayern Gegenwart und
Vergangenheit,” describing some of the excrementitious remedies
still existing in the folk-medicine of Bavaria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span></p>

<p>But while treatises upon this subject are by no means rare,
they are not accessible, except to those scholars who are within
reach of the largest libraries; and while all, or nearly all, indicate
the association of these practices with sorcery and witchcraft, as
well as with folk-medicine, no writer has hitherto ventured to
suggest the distinctively religious derivation to be ascribed to
them.</p>

<p>From the moment when the disgusting “Urine Dance of the
Zuñis” was performed in the author’s presence down to the hour
of concluding this work, a careful examination has been made of
more than one thousand treatises of various kinds and all sizes,
from the musty pig-skin covered black letter of the fifteenth century
to the more modest but not less valuable pamphlet of later
years. These treatises have covered the field of primitive religion,
medicine, and magic, and have likewise included a most
liberal portion of the best books of travel and observation among
primitive peoples in every part of the world; not only English
authorities, but also the writings of the best French, Spanish,
German, Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Celtic authors are here presented,
together with an examination of what has come down to
us from leaders of Eastern religious thought and from the monastic
“leeches” of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p>A great number of examples of the use of stercoraceous remedies
has been inserted under the head of “Therapeutics,” for two
excellent reasons: first, to show that the use of such remedies
was most widely disseminated; and secondly, to demonstrate that
this use had been handed down from century to century.</p>

<p>Had any other course been followed, objection might have been
raised that unusual remedies, or those of eccentric practitioners
only, had been sought for and quoted for the purpose of proving
that Filth Pharmacy was a thoroughly consistent and fully developed
school in the science of therapeutics, from the most primitive
times down to and even overlapping our own days.</p>

<p>A perusal of this volume cannot fail to convince the most
critical that it has been written in a spirit of fairness as much as
is possible to human nature, and without prepossession or prejudice
in any direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span></p>

<p>The fact that so many citations have been incorporated in this
compilation without comment, may be claimed as an additional
proof of the unbiassed character of the work.</p>

<p>No collection of facts constitutes a science. All that can properly
be done with facts not positively known to be related, is to
place them, as here placed, in juxtaposition, leaving the reader to
frame his own conclusions; by no other method can an author
escape the imputation of distorting or perverting evidence.</p>

<p>The great number of letters received from distinguished
scholars in all parts of the world, from Edinburgh to New South
Wales, attests the interest felt in this treatise, and at the same
time places the author under obligations which words cannot
express. Special acknowledgments are due to:—</p>

<p>All papers of this series which relate to the manners and usages
of the Indians of the southwestern portion of our territory, especially
those concerning the urine dances, phallic dances, snake
dances of the Zuñis, Mokis, and other Pueblos; the Navajoes of
New Mexico; the sun dance of the Sioux, etc., have been compiled
from memoranda gathered under the direction of Lieutenant-General
<span class="smcap">P. H. Sheridan</span>, in 1881 and 1882. Those referring to
Apaches, etc., of Arizona; to Northern Mexico; to pueblo ruins
and cliff and cave dwellings; to Sioux, Cheyennes, Crows, Arapahoes,
Pawnees, Shoshones, Utes, and other tribes, extending
back to 1869, were mainly obtained while the author was serving
as aide-de-camp upon the staff of Brigadier-General <span class="smcap">George
Crook</span>, during the campaigns conducted by that officer against
hostile tribes west of the Missouri, from the British line down
into Mexico, and to a considerable extent under General <span class="smcap">Crook’s</span>
direction, and with his encouragement and assistance.</p>

<p>The translations from German texts were made by Messrs.
Smith, Pratz, and Bunnemeyer, while for the analysis of the pills
made out of the ordure of the Grand Lama of Thibet, the author
desires to express his acknowledgments to Dr. W. M. Mew.</p>

<p>“The proper study of mankind is man.”</p>

<p>“The study of man is the study of man’s religion.”—<span class="smcap">Max Müller.</span></p>

<p>“Few who will give their minds to master the general principles of savage
religion will ever again think it ridiculous.... Far from its beliefs and practices
being a rubbish heap of miscellaneous folly, they are consistent and logical in so
high a degree as to begin, as soon as even roughly classified, to display the principles
of their formation and development; and these principles prove to be essentially
rational, though working in a mental condition of intense and inveterate
ignorance.”—Primitive Culture, E. B. Tylor, New York, 1874, vol. i. p. 21.</p>

</div>

<p>The object of the present monograph is to arrange in a form for
easy reference such allusions as have come under the author’s
notice bearing upon the use of human or animal ordure or urine or
articles apparently intended as substitutes for them, whether in rites
of a clearly religious or “medicine” type, or in those which, while not
pronouncedly such, have about them suggestions that they may be survivals
of former urine dances or ur-orgies among tribes and peoples from
whose later mode of life and thought they have been eliminated.</p>

<p>The difficulties surrounding the elucidation of this topic will no
doubt occur to every student of anthropology or ethnology. The rites
and practices herein spoken of are to be found only in communities
isolated from the world, and are such as even savages would shrink
from revealing unnecessarily to strangers; while, too frequently, observers
of intelligence have failed to improve opportunities for noting the
existence of rites of this nature, or else, restrained by a false modesty,
have clothed their remarks in vague and indefinite phraseology, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
that as a physician, to be skilful, must study his patients both in
sickness and in health, so the anthropologist must study man, not
alone wherein he reflects the grandeur of his Maker, but likewise in
his grosser and more animal propensities.</p>

<p>When the first edition of “Notes and Memoranda,” etc., upon this
subject, was distributed by the Smithsonian Institution, the author was
prepared to believe that, to a large and constantly increasing circle of
scholars, the subject would prove of unusual interest, and that, to repeat
the words of a great emperor, as quoted by a greater philosopher,
all belonging to primitive man was worthy of scrutiny and examination
by those who would become familiar with his history and evolution.</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to say, like the Emperor Maximilian, ‘homo
sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto,’ or translating his words literally,
‘I am a man; nothing pertaining to man I deem foreign to myself.’”—(Max
Müller, “Chips from a German Workshop.” Maximilian
was using a citation from Terence.)</p>

<p>The author also felt that to such a circle it would not be necessary
for him to make an apology analogous to that with which Pellegrini
sought to defend the noble profession of medicine in the early days of
printing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But it was with no inconsiderable amount of pride that he
saw his pamphlet honored by the earnest attention of men eminent in
the world of thought, who by suggestion and criticism, given in kindness
and received with gratitude, have contributed to the amplification
of the original “Notes and Memoranda” into the present treatise.</p>

<p>That these disgusting rites are distinctively religious in origin, no
one, after a careful perusal of all that is to be presented upon that
head, will care to deny; and that their examination will be productive
of important results will be equally incontrovertible when that examination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
shall be conducted on the broad principle that the benefit or
detriment mankind may have received from religion in general or from
any particular form of religion, can be ascertained only by a comparison
between man’s actions and principles of conduct in the earliest
stages of culture, and those observable while actuated by the religious
sentiment of the present day.</p>

<p>Hebrews and Christians will discover a common ground of congratulation
in the fact that believers in their systems are now absolutely
free from any suggestion of this filth taint, every example to the contrary
being in direct opposition to the spirit and practice of those two
great bodies to which the world’s civilization is so deeply indebted.</p>

<p>But under another point of view, the study of primitive man is an
impossibility and an absurdity unless prosecuted as an investigation
into his mode of religious thought, since religion guided every thought
and deed of his daily life. Rink, after saying that the “whole study
of prehistoric man ... which has hitherto almost exclusively been
founded upon the study of the ornaments, weapons, and other remains of
primitive peoples,” must in future be based upon an inquiry into their
spiritual thought, remarks that “The time will surely come when any
relic of spiritual life brought down to us from prehistoric mankind,
which may still be found in the folk-lore of the more isolated and primitive
nations, will be valued as highly as those primitive remains.”—(“Tales
and Traditions of the Eskimo,” Rink, Edinburgh, 1875, page 6
of Preface.)</p>

<p>Repugnant, therefore, as the subject is under most points of view,
the author has felt constrained to reproduce all that he has seen and
read, hoping that, in the fuller consideration that all forms of primitive
religion are now receiving, this, the most brutal, possibly, of all, may
claim some share of examination and discussion. To serve as a nucleus
for notes and memoranda since gleaned, the author has reproduced his
original monograph, first published in the Transactions of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, 1885, and read by
title at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, meeting, in the same year.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE URINE DANCE OF THE ZUÑIS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>On the evening of November 17, 1881, during my stay in the village
of Zuñi, New Mexico, the <i>Nehue-Cue</i>, one of the secret
orders of the Zuñis, sent word to Mr. Frank H. Cushing,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> whose guest
I was, that they would do us the unusual honor of coming to our house
to give us one of their characteristic dances, which, Cushing said, was
unprecedented.</p>

<p>The squaws of the governor’s family put the long living-room to
rights, sweeping the floor and sprinkling it with water to lay the dust.
Soon after dark the dancers entered; they were twelve in number, two
being boys. The centre men were naked, with the exception of black
breech-clouts of archaic style. The hair was worn naturally, with a
bunch of wild-turkey feathers tied in front, and one of corn husks over
each ear. White bands were painted across the face at eyes and
mouth. Each wore a collar or neckcloth of black woollen stuff. Broad
white bands, one inch wide, were painted around the body at the
navel, around the arms, the legs at mid-thighs, and knees. Tortoise-shell
rattles hung from the right knee. Blue woollen footless leggings
were worn with low-cut moccasins, and in the right hand each waved a
wand made of an ear of corn, trimmed with the plumage of the wild
turkey and macaw. The others were arrayed in old, cast-off American
Army clothing, and all wore white cotton night-caps, with corn-husks
twisted into the hair at top of head and ears. Several wore, in addition
to the tortoise-shell rattles, strings of brass sleigh-bells at knees.
One was more grotesquely attired than the rest, in a long India-rubber
gossamer “overall,” and with a pair of goggles, painted white, over his
eyes. His general “get-up” was a spirited take-off upon a Mexican
priest. Another was a very good counterfeit of a young woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>To the accompaniment of an oblong drum and of the rattles and bells
spoken of they shuffled into the long room, crammed with spectators of
both sexes and of all sizes and ages. Their song was apparently a
ludicrous reference to everything and everybody in sight, Cushing,
Mindeleff, and myself receiving special attention, to the uncontrolled
merriment of the red-skinned listeners. I had taken my station at
one side of the room, seated upon the banquette, and having in front
of me a rude bench or table, upon which was a small coal-oil lamp.
I suppose that in the halo diffused by the feeble light, and in my
“stained-glass attitude,” I must have borne some resemblance to the
pictures of saints hanging upon the walls of old Mexican churches;
to such a fancied resemblance I at least attribute the performance
which followed.</p>

<p>The dancers suddenly wheeled into line, threw themselves on their
knees before my table, and with extravagant beatings of breast began
an outlandish but faithful mockery of a Mexican Catholic congregation
at vespers. One bawled out a parody upon the pater-noster, another
mumbled along in the manner of an old man reciting the rosary,
while the fellow with the India-rubber coat jumped up and began a
passionate exhortation or sermon, which for mimetic fidelity was
incomparable. This kept the audience laughing with sore sides
for some moments, until, at a signal from the leader, the dancers
suddenly countermarched out of the room in single file as they had
entered.</p>

<p>An interlude followed of ten minutes, during which the dusty floor
was sprinkled by men who spat water forcibly from their mouths.
The <i>Nehue-Cue</i> re-entered; this time two of their number were stark
naked. Their singing was very peculiar, and sounded like a chorus of
chimney-sweeps, and their dance became a stiff-legged jump, with heels
kept twelve inches apart. After they had ambled around the room
two or three times, Cushing announced in the Zuñi language that a
“feast” was ready for them, at which they loudly roared their approbation,
and advanced to strike hands with the munificent “Americanos,”
addressing us in a funny gibberish of broken Spanish, English,
and Zuñi. They then squatted upon the ground and consumed with
zest large “ollas” full of tea, and dishes of hard tack and sugar. As
they were about finishing this a squaw entered, carrying an “olla” of
urine, of which the filthy brutes drank heartily.</p>

<p>I refused to believe the evidence of my senses, and asked Cushing if
that were really human urine. “Why, certainly,” replied he, “and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
here comes more of it.” This time it was a large tin pailful, not less
than two gallons. I was standing by the squaw as she offered this
strange and abominable refreshment. She made a motion with her
hand to indicate to me that it was urine, and one of the old men repeated
the Spanish word <i>mear</i> (to urinate), while my sense of smell
demonstrated the truth of their statements.</p>

<p>The dancers swallowed great draughts, smacked their lips, and, amid
the roaring merriment of the spectators, remarked that it was very,
very good. The clowns were now upon their mettle, each trying to
surpass his neighbors in feats of nastiness. One swallowed a fragment
of corn-husk, saying he thought it very good and better than bread;
his <i>vis-à-vis</i> attempted to chew and gulp down a piece of filthy rag.
Another expressed regret that the dance had not been held out of
doors, in one of the plazas; there they could show what they could do.
There they always made it a point of honor to eat the excrement of
men and dogs.</p>

<p>For my own part, I felt satisfied with the omission, particularly as
the room, stuffed with one hundred Zuñis, had become so foul and
filthy as to be almost unbearable. The dance, as good luck would
have it, did not last many minutes, and we soon had a chance to run
into the refreshing night air.</p>

<p>To this outline description of a disgusting rite, I have little to add.
The Zuñis, in explanation, stated that the <i>Nehue-Cue</i> were a Medicine
Order, which held these dances from time to time to inure the stomachs
of members to any kind of food, no matter how revolting. This statement
may seem plausible enough when we understand that religion
and medicine, among primitive races, are almost always one and the
same thing, or at least so closely intertwined, that it is a matter of
difficulty to decide where one begins and the other ends.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Religion, in its dramatic ceremonial, preserves, to some extent, the
history of the particular race in which it dwells. Among nations of
high development, miracles, moralities, and passion plays have taught,
down to our own day, in object lessons, the sacred history in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
spectators believed. Some analogous purpose may have been held in
view by the first organizers of the urine dance. In their early history,
the Zuñis and other Pueblos suffered from constant warfare with savage
antagonists and with each other. From the position of their villages,
long sieges must of necessity have been sustained, in which sieges
famine and disease, no doubt, were the allies counted upon by the investing
forces. We may have in this abominable dance a tradition of
the extremity to which the Zuñis of the long ago were reduced at some
unknown period. A similar catastrophe in the history of the Jews is
intimated in 2 Kings xviii. 27; and again in Isaiah xxxvi. 12: “But
Rab-shakeh said unto them: hath my master sent me to thy master,
and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
which sit on the wall, that they may <i>eat their own dung and drink their
own piss</i> with you?” In the course of my studies I came across a reference
to a very similar dance, occurring among one of the fanatical
sects of the Arabian Bedouins, but the journal in which it was recorded,
the “London Lancet,” I think, was unfortunately mislaid.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>As illustrative of the tenacity with which such vile ceremonial, once
adopted by a sect, will adhere to it and become ingrafted upon its life,
long after the motives which have suggested or commended it have
vanished in oblivion, let me quote a few lines from Max Müller’s
“Chips from a German Workshop,” “Essay upon the Parsees,” pp.
163, 164, Scribner’s edition, 1869: “The <i>nirang</i> is the urine of a cow,
ox, or she-goat, and the rubbing of it over the face and hands is the
second thing a Parsee does after getting out of bed. Either before
applying the <i>nirang</i> to the face and hands, or while it remains on the
hands after being applied, he should not touch anything directly with
his hands; but, in order to wash out the <i>nirang</i>, he either asks somebody
else to pour water on his hands, or resorts to the device of taking
hold of the pot through the intervention of a piece of cloth, such as a
handkerchief or his <i>sudra</i>,—that is, his blouse. He first pours water
on his hand, then takes the pot in that hand and washes his other
hand, face, and feet.”—(Quoting from Dadabhai-Nadrosi’s “Description
of the Parsees.”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Continuing, Max Müller says: “Strange as this process of purification
may appear, it becomes perfectly disgusting when we are told that
women, after childbirth, have not only to undergo this sacred ablution,
but actually to drink a little of the <i>nirang</i>, and that the same rite is
imposed on children at the time of their investiture with the <i>Sudra</i>
and <i>Koshti</i>,—the badges of the Zoroastrian faith.”</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it may be advisable to clinch the fact that
the Urine Dance of the Zuñis was not a sporadic instance, peculiar to
that pueblo, or to a particular portion of that pueblo; it was a tribal
rite, recognized and commended by the whole community, and entering
into the ritual of all the pueblos of the Southwest.</p>

<p>Upon this point a few words from the author’s personal journal of
Nov. 24, 1881, may well be introduced to prove its existence among
the Moquis,—the informant, Nana-je, being a young Moqui of the
strictest integrity and veracity: “In the circle I noticed Nana-je and
the young Nehue-cue boy who was with us a few nights since. During
a pause in the conversation I asked the young Nehue if he had been
drinking any urine lately. This occasioned some laughter among the
Indians; but to my surprise Nana-je spoke up and said: ‘I am a Nehue
also. The Nehue of Zuñi are nothing to the same order among the
Moquis. There the Nehue not only drink urine, as you saw done the
other night, but also eat human and animal excrement. They eat it
here too; but we eat all that is set before us. We have a medicine
which makes us drunk like whiskey; we drink a lot of that before we
commence; it makes us drunk. We don’t care what happens; and
nothing of that kind that we eat or drink can ever do us any harm.’
The Nehue-cue are to be found in all the pueblos on the Rio Grande
and close to it; only there they don’t do things openly.”</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we have the testimony of Mr. Thomas V.
Keam, who has lived for many years among the Moquis, and who confirms
from personal observation all that has been here said.</p>

<p>The extracts from personal correspondence with Professor Bandelier
are of special value, that gentleman having devoted years of painstaking
investigation to the history of the Pueblos, and acquired a most
intimate knowledge of them, based upon constant personal observation
and scholarship of the highest order.</p>

<p>In a personal letter, dated Santa Fé, N. M., June 7, 1888, he tells,
among much other most interesting information, that he saw at the
Pueblo of Cochiti, on Nov. 10, 1880, “the Koshare eating their own
excrement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>The following description of the “Club-house” of the Nehue-cue
may be of interest: “It was twenty-one paces long, nine paces wide,
with a banquette running round on three sides; in front of the altar
were sacred bowls of earthenware, with paintings of tadpoles to typify
water of summer, frogs for perennial water, and the sea-serpent for
ocean water. (They describe the sea-serpent (<i>vibora del mar</i>) as very
large, with feathers (spray?) on its head, eating people who went into
the water, and when cut up with big knives yielding a great deal of
oil.) In the first of the sacred dishes was a conch-shell from the sea,
wands made of ears of corn, with hearts of chalchihuitl, and exterior
ornamentation of the plumage of the parrot and turkey. Bowls of
sacred meal (<i>kunque</i>) were on the floor; this sacred meal, to be found
in niches in the house of every Zuñi, or for that matter of almost every
pueblo throughout New Mexico and Arizona, is generally made of a
mixture of blue corn-meal, shells, and chalchihuitl; but for more
solemn occasions, as the old Indian Pedro Pino assured me, sea-sand
is added. Around the room at intervals were pictographs of birds,—ducks
and others,—nine in number on one side, and nine of clown-gods
on the other. These pictures were fairly well delineated in black
and in red and yellow ochre. The god of “The Winged Knife” was
represented back of the altar. In this room were also kept several of
the painted oblong wooden drums seen in every sacred dance.”—(Extract
from personal notes of Captain Bourke, Nov. 17, 1881.)</p>

<p>“Have you ever, while in New Mexico, witnessed the dance of that
cluster or order called the “Ko-sha-re” among the Queres, “Ko-sa-re”
among the Tehuas, and “Shu-re” among the Tiguas? I have witnessed
it several times; and these gentlemen, many of whom belong to
the circle of my warm personal friends, display a peculiar appetite
for what the human body commonly not only rejects, but also ejects.
I am sorry that I did not know of your work any sooner, as else I could
have given you very full descriptions of these dances. The cluster in
question have a very peculiar task, inasmuch as the ripening of all
kinds of fruits is at their charge, even the fruit in the mother’s womb,
and their rites are therefore of sickening obscenity. The swallowing
of excrements is but a mild performance in comparison with what I
have been obliged to see and witness.”—(Letter from Professor Bandelier,
dated at Santa Fé, N. M., April 25, 1888.)</p>

<p>Major Ferry, whom the author met in the office of General Robert
McFeely, Acting Secretary of War, Oct. 5, 1888, stated that he was
the son of the first Protestant missionary to build a church at Mackinaw,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
and that the Indians of the Ojibway tribe who lived in the neighborhood
of that post indulged from time to time in orgies in which the
drinking of urine was a feature.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel W. Lord, a gentleman who was for a time associated with
Mr. Frank H. Cushing in his investigations among the Zuñis of New
Mexico, makes the following statement:—</p>

<p>“In June, 1888, I was a spectator of an orgy at the Zuñi pueblo in
New Mexico. The ceremonial dance of that afternoon had been finished
in the small plaza generally used for dances in the northwestern part
of the pueblo when this supplementary rite took place. One of the
Indians brought into the plaza the excrement to be employed, and it
was passed from hand to hand and eaten. Those taking part in the
ceremony were few in number, certainly not more than eight or ten.
They drank urine from a large shallow bowl, and meanwhile kept up a
running fire of comments and exclamations among themselves, as if
urging one another to drink heartily, which indeed they did. At
last one of those taking part was made sick, and vomited after the
ceremony was over. The inhabitants of the pueblo upon the housetops
overlooking the plaza were interested spectators of the scene.
Some of the sallies of the actors were received with laughter, and
others with signs of disgust and repugnance, but not of disapprobation.
The ceremony was not repeated, to my knowledge, during my stay at
the pueblo, which continued till July, 1889.”—(Personal letter to
Captain Bourke, dated Washington, D. C., May 26, 1890.)</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FEAST OF FOOLS IN EUROPE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Closely corresponding to this urine dance of the Zuñis was the
Feast of Fools in Continental Europe, the description of which
here given is quoted from Dulaure:—</p>

<p>“La grand’messe commençait alors; tous les ecclésiastiques y assistaient,
le visage barbouillé de noir, ou couvert d’un masque hideux ou
ridicule. Pendant la célébration, les uns, vêtus en baladins ou en femmes,
dansaient au milieu du chœur et y chantaient des chansons bouffones
ou obscènes. Les autres venaient manger sur l’autel des saucisses et
des boudins, jouer aux cartes ou aux dez, devant le prêtre célébrant,
l’encensaient avec un encensoir, ou brûlaient de vieilles savates, et lui
en faisaient respirer la fumée.</p>

<p>“Après la messe, nouveaux actes d’extravagance et d’impiété. Les
prêtres, confondus avec les habitants des deux sexes, couraient, dansaient
dans l’église, s’excitaient à toutes les folies, à toutes les actions
licencieuses que leur inspirait une imagination effrénée. Plus de honte,
plus de pudeur; aucune digue n’arrêtait le débordement de la folie et
des passions....</p>

<p>“Au milieu du tumulte, des blasphêmes et des chants dissolus, on
voyait les uns se dépouiller entièrement de leurs habits, d’autres se
livrer aux actes du plus honteux libertinage.</p>

<p>“ ... Les acteurs, montés sur des tombereaux pleins d’ordures,
s’amusaient à en jeter à la populace qui les entouraient.... Ces
scènes étaient toujours accompagnées de chansons ordurières et impies.”—(Dulaure,
“Des Divinités Génératrices,” chap. xv. p. 315 <i>et seq.</i>,
Paris, 1825.)</p>

<h3>COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FEAST OF FOOLS AND THE URINE DANCE.</h3>

<p>In the above description may be seen that the principal actors (taking
possession of the church during high mass) had their faces daubed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and painted, or masked in a harlequin manner; that they were dressed
as clowns or as women; that they ate upon the altar itself sausages
and blood-puddings. Now the word “blood-pudding” in French is
<i>boudin</i>; but <i>boudin</i> also meant “excrement.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Add to this the feature
that these clowns, after leaving the church, took their stand in
dung-carts (<i>tombereaux</i>), and threw <i>ordure</i> upon the by-standers; and
finally that some of these actors appeared perfectly naked (“on voyait
les uns se dépouiller entièrement de leurs habits”), and it must be admitted
that there is certainly a wonderful concatenation of resemblances
between these filthy and inexplicable rites on different sides of a great
ocean.</p>

<h3>THE FEAST OF FOOLS TRACED BACK TO MOST ANCIENT TIMES.</h3>

<p>Dulaure makes no attempt to trace the origin of these ceremonies in
France; he contents himself with saying, “Ces cérémonies ... ont
subsisté pendant douze ou quinze siècles,” or, in other words, that
they were of Pagan origin. In twelve or fifteen hundred years the
rite might have been well sublimed from the eating of pure excrement,
as among the Zuñis, to the consumption of the <i>boudin</i>, the excrement
symbol.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Conceding for the moment that this suspicion is correct, we
have a proof of the antiquity of the urine dance among the Zuñis. So
great is the resemblance between the Zuñi rite and that just described
by Dulaure that we should have reason for believing that the new country
borrowed from the old some of the features transmitted to the
present day; and were there not evidence of a wider distribution of this
observance, it might be assumed that the Catholic missionaries (who
worked among the Zuñis from 1580, or thereabout, and excepting during
intervals of revolt remained on duty in Zuñi down to the period of
American occupation) found the obscene and disgusting orgy in full
vigor, and realizing the danger, by unwise precipitancy, of destroying
all hopes of winning over this people, shrewdly concluded to tacitly accept
the religious abnormality and to engraft upon it the plant flourishing
so bravely in the vicinity of their European homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3>DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FEAST OF FOOLS.</h3>

<p>In France the Feast of Fools disappeared only with the French
Revolution; in other parts of Continental Europe it began to wane
about the time of the Reformation. In England, “the abbot of unreason,”
whose pranks are outlined by Sir Walter Scott in his novel
“The Abbot,” the miracle plays which had once served a good purpose
in teaching Scriptural lessons to an illiterate peasantry, and the
“moralities” of the same general purport, faded away under the stern
antagonism of the Puritan iconoclast. The Feast of Fools, as such, was
abolished by Henry VIII. <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1541.—(See “The English Reformation,”
Francis Charles Massingberd, London, 1857, p. 125.)<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Picart’s account of the Feast of Fools is similar to that given by
Dulaure. He says that it took place in the church, at Christmas tide,
and was borrowed from the Roman Saturnalia; was never approved
of by the Christian church as a body, but fought against from the
earliest times:—</p>

<p>“Les uns étoient masqués ou avec des visages barbouillés qui faisoìent
peur ou qui faisoìent rire; les autres en habits de femmes ou de pantomimes,
tels que sont les ministres du théatre.</p>

<p>“Ils dansoient dans le chœur, en entrant, et chantoient des chansons
obscènes. Les Diacres et les sou-diacres prenoient plaisir à manger des
boudins et des saucisses sur l’autel, au nez du prêtre célébrant; ils
jouoient à des jeux aux cartes et aux dés; ils mettoient dans l’encensoir
quelques morceaux de vieilles savates pour lui faire respirer une
mauvaise odeur.</p>

<p>“Après la messe, chacun couroit, sautoit et dansoit par l’église avec
tant d’impudence, que quelques uns n’àvoient pas honte de se porter à
toutes sortes d’indécences et de se dépouillier entièremênt; ensuite, ils se
faisoìent trainer par les rues dans des tombereaux pleins d’ordures, d’ou
ils prenoient plaisir d’en jeter à la populace qui s’assembloit autour d’eux.</p>

<p>“Ils s’arrétoient et faisoient de leurs corps des mouvements et des
postures lascives qu’ils accompagnoient de paroles impudiques.</p>

<p>“Les plus impudiques d’entre les séculiers se mêloient parmi le
clergé, pour faire aussi quelques personnages de Foux en habits ecclésiastiques
de Moines et de Religieuses.”—(Picart, “Coûtumes et Cérémonies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
réligieuses de toutes les Nations du Monde,” Amsterdam, Holland,
1729, vol. ix. pp. 5, 6).</p>

<p>Diderot and d’Alembert use almost the same terms; the officiating
clergy were clad “les uns comme des bouffons, les autres en habits de
femmes ou masqués d’une façon monstrueuse ... ils mangeaient et
jouaient aux dés sur l’autel à côté du prêtre qui célébroit la messe. Ils
mettoient des ordures dans les encensoirs.” They say that the details
would not bear repetition. This feast prevailed generally in Continental
Europe from Christmas to Epiphany, and in England, especially in
York.—(Diderot and D’Alembert, Encyclopædia, “Fête des Fous,”
Geneva, Switzerland, 1779.)</p>

<p>Markham discovers a resemblance between the “Monk of Misrule”
of Christendom in the Middle Ages, and “Gylongs dressed in parti-colored
habits ... singing and dancing before the Teshu Lama in
Thibet.”—(See Markham’s “Thibet,” London, 1879, page 95, footnote.
See also Bogle’s description of the ceremonies in connection with the
New Year, in presence of the Teshu Lama, in Markham’s “Thibet,”
p. 106.)</p>

<p>The Mandans had an annual festival one of the features of which
was “the expulsion of the devil.... He was chased from the village
... the women pelting him with dirt.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, London, 1890, vol. ii. p. 184, quoting Catlin’s “North American
Indians,” page 166.)</p>

<p>The authors who have referred at greater or less length, and with
more or less preciseness, to the Feast of Fools, Feast of Asses, and
others of that kind, are legion; unfortunately, without an exception,
they have contented themselves with a description of the obscene
absurdities connected with these popular religious gatherings, without
attempting an analysis of the underlying motives which prompted
them, or even making an intelligent effort to trace their origin. Where
the last has been alluded to at all, it has almost invariably been with
the assertion that the Feast of Fools was a survival from the Roman
Saturnalia.</p>

<p>This can scarcely have been the case; in the progress of this work
it is purposed to make evident that the use of human and animal egestæ
in religious ceremonial was common all over the world, antedating the
Roman Saturnalia, or at least totally unconnected with it. The correct
interpretation of the Feast of Fools would, therefore, seem to be that
which recognized it as a reversion to a pre-Christian type of thought
dating back to the earliest appearance of the Aryan race in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The introduction of the Christian religion was accompanied by many
compromises; wherever it was opposed by too great odds, in point of
numbers, it permitted the retention of practices repugnant to its own
teachings; or, if the term “permitted” be an objectionable one to
some ears, we may substitute the expression “acquiesced in” for “permitted,”
and then follow down the course of persistent antagonism,
which, after a while, modified permanent retention into a periodical,
perhaps an irregular, resumption, and this last into burlesque
survival.</p>

<p>Ducange, in his “Glossarium,” introduces the Ritual of the Mass at
the Feast of the Ass, familiar to most readers,—but he adds nothing
to what has already been quoted in regard to the Feast of Fools
itself.</p>

<p>This reference from Ducange will also be found in Schaff-Herzog,
“Religious Encyclopædia,” New York, 1882, article “Festival.” This
Ritual was written out in 1369 at Viviers in France.</p>

<p>Fosbroke gives no information on the subject of the Feast of Fools
not already incorporated in this volume. He simply says: “In the
Feast of Fools they put on masks, took the dress, etc., of women,
danced and sung in the choir, ate fat cakes upon the horn of the altar,
where the celebrating priest played at dice, put stinking stuff from the
leather of old shoes in the censer, jumped about the church, with the
addition of obscene jests, songs, and unseemly attitudes. Another part
of this indecorous buffoonery was shaving the precentor of fools upon
a stage, erected before the church, in the presence of the people; and
during the operation he amused them with lewd and vulgar discourses
and gestures. They also had carts full of ordure which they threw
occasionally upon the populace. This exhibition was always in Christmas
time or near it, but was not confined to a particular day.”—(Rev.
Thomas Dudley Fosbroke, “Cyclopædia of Antiquities,” London,
1843, vol. 2, article “Festivals.” Most of his information seems
to be derived from Ducange.)</p>

<p>“The Feast of Fools was celebrated as before in various masquerades
of Women, Lions, Players, etc. They danced and sung in the
choir, ate fat cakes upon the horn of the altar, where the celebrating
priest played at dice, put stinking stuff from the leather of old shoes
into the censer, ran, jumped, etc., through the church.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>In Brand’s “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1873, vol. 3, pp. 497-505,
will be found a pretty full description of the Lords of Misrule,
but the only reference of value for our purposes is one from Polydorus
Virgil, who recognized the derivation of these Feasts from the Roman
Saturnalia. “There is nothing,” says the author of the essay to retrieve
the Ancient Celtic, “that will bear a clearer demonstration than
that the primitive Christians, by way of conciliating the Pagans to a
better worship, humored their prejudices by yielding to a conformity
of names and even of customs, where they did not interfere with the
fundamentals of the Christian doctrine.... Among these, in imitation
of the Roman Saturnalia, was the Festum Fatuorum, when part
of the jollity of the season was a burlesque election of a mock-pope,
mock-cardinals, mock-bishops, attended with a thousand ridiculous
and indecent ceremonies, gambols, and antics, such as singing and
dancing in the churches, in lewd attitudes, to ludicrous anthems, all
allusively to the exploded pretensions of the Druids whom these sports
were calculated to expose to scorn and derision. This Feast of Fools,”
continues he, “had its designed effect, and contributed perhaps more
to the extermination of these heathens than all the collateral aids of
fire and sword, neither of which were spared in the persecution of
them.”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872, vol. i. p. 36.)</p>

<p>Strutt’s “Sports and Pastimes,” edition of London, 1855, article
“Festival of Fools,” in lib. iv. cap. 3, contains nothing not already
learned.</p>

<p>Jacob Grimm, “Teutonic Mythology” (Stallybrass), London, 1882,
vol. i. p. 92, has the following:—</p>

<p>“The collection of the Letters of Boniface has a passage lamenting
the confusion of Christian and heathen rites into which foolish or reckless
priests had suffered themselves to fall.”</p>

<p>Banier shows that on the First of January the people of France ran
about the streets of their towns, disguised as animals, masked and
playing all sorts of pranks. This custom was derived from the Druids
and lasted in full vigor “to the twelfth century of the Christian era.”—(“Mythology,”
Banier, vol. iii. p. 247.)</p>

<p>“The heathen gods even, though represented as feeble in comparison
with the true God, were not always pictured as powerless in themselves;
they were perverted into hostile, malignant powers, into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
demons, sorcerers, and giants, who had to be put down, but were
nevertheless credited with a certain mischievous activity and influence.
Here and there a heathen tradition or a superstitious custom lived on
by merely changing the names and applying to Christ, Mary, and the
saints what had formerly been related and believed of idols.”—(“Teutonic
Mythology,” Jacob Grimm (Stallybrass), London, 1882, vol. i. Introduction,
page 5.) ... “At the time when Christianity began to press
forward, many of the heathen seem to have entertained the notion,
which the missionaries did all in their power to resist, of combining the
new doctrine with the ancient faith and even of fusing them into one.—(Idem,
p. 7.) ... Of Norsemen, as well as of Anglo-Saxons, we are
told that some believed at the same time in Christ and in heathen gods,
or at least continued to invoke the latter in particular cases in which
they had formerly proved helpful to them. So even by Christians
much later the old deities seem to have been named and their aid invoked
in enchantments and spells.—(Idem, pp. 7 and 8.) ... The
Teutonic races forsook the faith of their fathers very gradually and
slowly from the fourth to the eleventh century.”—(Idem, p. 8.)</p>

<p>On the following pages, 9, 10, and 11, Grimm shows us how little is
really known of the religions of ancient Europe, whether of the Latin
or of the Teutonic or Celtic races; he alludes to “the gradual transformation
of the gods into devils, of the wise women into witches, of
the worship into superstitious customs.—(Idem, p. 11.) Heathen festivals
and customs were transformed into Christian.—(Idem, p. 12.) ...
Private sacrifices, intended for gods or spirits, could not be eradicated
among the people for a long time, because they were bound up with
customs and festivals, and might at last become an unmeaning practice.”—(Idem,
vol. iii. p. 1009.)</p>

<p>“It is a natural and well-known fact that the gods of one nation
become the devils of their conquerors or successors.”—(Folk-Medicine,
William George Black, London, 1883, p. 12.)</p>

<p>“Few things are so indestructible as a superstitious belief once implanted
in human credulity.... The sacred rites of the superseded
faith become the forbidden magic of its successors.”—(“History of
the Inquisition,” Henry Charles Lea, New York, 1888, vol. iii. p. 379.)
“Its gods become evil spirits.”—(Idem, p. 379.) ... The same
views are advanced in Madame Blavatsky’s “Isis Unveiled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<h3>THE “SZOMBATIAKS” OF TRANSYLVANIA.</h3>

<p>In further explanation of the tenacity with which older cults survive
long after the newer religions seem to have gained predominance in
countries and nations, it is extremely appropriate to introduce a passage
from an article in the “St. James’ Gazette,” entitled “Crypto-Jews,”
reprinted in the Sunday edition of the “Sun,” New York, sometime
in October, 1888.</p>

<p>The writer, in speaking of the Szombatiaks of Transylvania, remarks:
“The crypto-Judaism of the Szombatiaks was suspected for centuries,
but not until twenty years ago was it positively known. Then, on the
occasion of a Jewish emancipation act for Hungary, the sturdy old
peasants, indistinguishable in dress, manners, and language from the
native Szeklers, sent a deputation to Pesth to ask that their names
might be erased from the church rolls. They explained that they
were Jews whose forefathers had settled in Hungary at the time of
the expedition of Titus to Dacia. Though baptized, married, and
buried as Christians, maintaining Christian pastors, and attending
Christian churches, they had always in secret observed their ancient
religion.”</p>

<p>It is a matter of surprise to find so little on the subject of the Feast
of Fools in Forlong’s comprehensive work on Religion. All that he
says is that “the Yule-tide fêtes were noted for men disguising themselves
as women, and <i>vice versa</i>, showing their connection with the old
Sigillaria of the Saturnalia, which, formerly observed on the 14th of
January, were afterwards continued to three, four, five, and some say
seven days, and by the common people even until Candlemas Day.
Both were prohibited when their gross immoralities became apparent
to better educated communities. ‘In Paris,’ says Trusler in his
‘Chronology,’ ‘the First of January was observed as Mask Day for
two hundred and forty years, when all sorts of indecencies and obscene
rites occurred.’”—(“Rivers of Life,” Forlong, London, 1883, vol. i.
p. 434.)</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there is evidence of its survival among the
rustic population of Germany. Brand enumerates many curious practices
of the carnival just before Ash Wednesday, and even on that day, after
the distribution of the ashes. Young maidens in Germany were carried
“in a cart or tumbrel” by the youths of the village to the nearest brook
or pond, and there thoroughly ducked, the drawers of the cart throwing
dust and ashes on all near them. In Oxfordshire it was the custom for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
bands of boys to stroll from house to house singing and demanding largess
of eggs and bacon, not receiving which, “they commonly cut the
latch of the door or stop the key-hole with dirt” (“Popular Antiquities,”
London, 1872, vol. i. pp. 94 <i>et seq.</i>, article “Ash Wednesday”),
“or leave some more nasty token of displeasure” (idem). This may
have been a survival from the Feast of Fools. Brand refers to Hospinian,
“De Origine Festorum Christianorum,” “for several curious
customs and ceremonies observed abroad during the three first days of
the Quinquagesima week” (p. 99).</p>

<p>Turning from the Teutonic race to the Slav, we find that the Feast
of Fools seems still to linger among the Russian peasantry. “At one
time a custom prevailed of going about from one friend’s house to another
masked, and committing every conceivable prank. Then the
people feasted on blinnies,—a pancake similar to the English crumpet”
(“A Hoosier in Russia,” Perry S. Heath, New York, 1888, p. 109);
all this at Christmas-tide.</p>

<p>Something very much like it, without any obscene features, was
noted by Blunt in the early years of the present century. See his
“Vestiges,” p. 119.</p>

<p>Hone (“Ancient Mysteries Described,” London, 1823, pp. 148 <i>et
seq.</i>) thinks that a Jewish imitation of the Greek drama of the close of
the second century, whose plot, characters, etc., were taken from the
Exodus, was the first miracle play. The author was one Ezekiel, who
was believed to have written it with a patriotic purpose after the destruction
of Jerusalem. The early Fathers—Cyril, Tertullian, Cyprian,
Basil, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Augustine—inveighed against
sacred dramas; but the outside pressure was too great, and the Church
was forced to yield to popular demand.</p>

<p>As late as the fifteenth century Pius II. said that the Italian priests
had probably never read the New Testament; and Robert Stephens
made the same charge against the doctors of the Sorbonne in the same
age.</p>

<p>The necessity of dramatic representation would therefore soon outweigh
objections made on the score of historical anachronism or
doctrinal inaccuracy in these miracle plays.</p>

<p>Theophylact, Patriarch of Constantinople in the tenth century, is
credited by the Byzantine historian Cedranus with the introduction
of the Feast of Fools and Feast of the Ass, “thereby scandalizing
God and the memory of his saints, by admitting into the sacred service
diabolical dances, exclamations of ribaldry, and ballads borrowed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the streets and brothels.”—(Hone, quoting Wharton, “Miscellaneous
Writings upon the Drama and Fiction,” vol. ii. p. 369.)</p>

<p>In 1590, at Paris, the mendicant orders, led by the Bishop of Senlis,
paraded the streets with tucked up robes, representing the Church
Militant. These processions were believed to be the legitimate offspring
of heathen pageants,—that is, that of Saint Peter in Vinculis
was believed to be the transformed spectacle in honor of Augustus’s
victory at Actium, etc.</p>

<p>Beletus describes the Feast of Fools as he saw it in the twelfth century.
His account, given by Hone (p. 159), agrees word for word with
that of Dulaure, excepting that, through an error of translation perhaps,
he is made to say that the participants “ate rich puddings on
the corners of the altar;” but as the word “pudding” meant even in
the English language a meat pudding or sausage, the error is an immaterial
one.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo describes in brief the Feast of Fools as seen at Paris in
1482, on the 6th of January. He says that the “Fête des Rois and the
Fête des Fous were united in a double holiday since time immemorial.”
His description is very meagre, but from it may be extracted the information
that in these feasts of fools female actresses appeared masked;
that the noblest and greatest personages in the kingdom of France
were among the prominent spectators; but there is not much else.
(See the opening chapters of “Notre Dame.”)</p>

<p>The Festival of Moharren in Persia is a kind of miracle play, or
Passion play, commemorating the rise and progress of Islamism.
“Among these occurrences are the deaths of Hassein and Hossein, the
birth of the prophet, the martyrdom of the Imam Rezah, and the death
of Fatimeh, daughter of Mahomet.”—(Benjamin, “Persia,” London,
1887.)</p>

<p>This reference to the use of pudding or sausage on the altar itself is
the most persistent feature in the descriptions of the whole ceremony.
But little difficulty will be experienced in showing that it was originally
an excrement sausage, prepared and offered up, perhaps eaten, for a
definite purpose. This phase of the subject will be considered further
on; for the present only one citation need be introduced to show that
in carnival time human excrement itself, and not the symbol, made its
appearance:—</p>

<p>“The following extract from Barnaby Googe’s translation of ‘Naogeorgus’
will show the extent of these festivities (that is, those of the
carnival at Shrove Tuesday). After describing the wanton behavior of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
men dressed as women and of women arrayed in the garb of men, of
clowns dressed as devils, as animals, or running about perfectly naked,
the account goes on to say:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘But others bear a torde, that on a cushion soft they lay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one there is that with a flap doth keep the flies away:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would there might another be, an officer of those,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose room might serve to take away the scent from every nose.’”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Quoted in Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872, vol. i. p. 66,
article “Shrove Tuesday.”)</p>

<p>The Puritan’s horror of heathenish rites and superstitious vestiges
had for its basis something far above unreasoning fanaticism; he realized,
if not through learned study, by an intuition which had all the
force of genius, that every unmeaning practice, every rustic observance,
which could not prove its title clear to a noble genealogy was a pagan
survival, which conscience required him to tear up and destroy, root
and branch.</p>

<p>The Puritan may have made himself very much of a burden and a
nuisance to his neighbors before his self-imposed task was completed,
yet it is worthy of remark and of praise that his mission was a most
effectual one in wiping from the face of the earth innumerable vestiges
of pre-Christian idolatry.</p>

<p>This being understood, some importance attaches to the following
otherwise vague couplet from “Hudibras.”</p>

<p>“Butler mentions the black pudding in his ‘Hudibras,’ speaking of
the religious scruples of some of the fanatics of his time:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Some for abolishing black pudding,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And eating nothing with the blood in.’”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872, vol. i. p. 400, article
“Martinmas.”)</p>

<p>These sausages, made in links, certainly suggest the <i>boudins</i> of the
Feast of Fools. They were made from the flesh, blood, and entrails of
pork killed by several families in common on the 17th day of December,
known as “Sow Day.”</p>

<p>In the early days of the Reformation in Germany, in the May
games, the Pope was “portrayed in his pontificalibus riding on a great
sow, and holding before her taster a dirty pudding.”—(Harington,
“Ajax,” p. 35.)</p>

<p>The most sensible explanation of the Feast of Fools that has as yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
appeared is to be found in Frazer’s “Golden Bough” (London, 1890,
vol. i. pp. 218 <i>et seq.</i>, article “Temporary Kings”). He shows that
the regal power was not in ancient times a life tenure, but was either
revoked under the direction of the priestly body when the incumbent
began to show signs of increasing age and diminishing mental powers,
or at the expiration of a fixed period,—generally about twelve years.
In the lapse of time the king’s abdication became an empty form, and
his renunciation of powers purely farcical, his temporary successor a
clown who amused the fickle populace during his ephemeral assumption
of honors. Examples are drawn from Babylonia, Cambodia, Siam,
Egypt, India, etc., the odd feature being that these festivals occur at
dates ranging from our February to April. During the festival in Siam,
in the month of April, “the dancing Brahmans carry buffalo horns with
which they draw water from a large copper caldron and sprinkle it
on the people; this is supposed to bring good luck.”—(“The Golden
Bough,” James G. Fraser, M.A., London, 1890, vol. i. p. 230.)</p>

<p>In the preceding paragraph we have a distinct survival. The buffalo
horns may represent phalli, and the water may be a substitute for a
liquid which to the present generation might be more objectionable.</p>

<p>But upon another matter stress should be laid; in both the Feast
of Fools and in the Urine Dance of the Zuñis, it has been shown that
some of the actors were naked or disguised as women.</p>

<p>No attempt is made to prove anything in regard to the European
orgy, because research has thrown no light upon the reasons for which
the participants assumed the raiment of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>In the case of the Zuñis, the author has had, from the first, a suspicion,
which he took occasion to communicate to Professor F. W. Putnam
three years since, that these individuals were of the class called
by Father Lafitau “hommes habillés en femme,” and referred to with
such frequency by the earliest French and Spanish authorities. This
suspicion has been strengthened by correspondence lately received
from Professor Bandelier which is, however, suppressed at the request
of the latter.</p>

<p>In this connection, the student should not fail to read the remarkable
contribution of A. B. Holder, M. D., of Memphis, Tennessee, in
the New York Medical Journal of Dec. 7, 1889, entitled “The Boté:
description of a peculiar sexual perversion found among the North
American Indians.”</p>

<p>An explanation of the “hommes habillés en femme,” may be suggested
in the following from Boas, descriptive of certain religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
dances of the Eskimo: “Those who were born in abnormal presentations,
wear women’s dresses at this feast, and must make their round
in a direction opposite to the movement of the sun.”—(“The Central
Eskimo,” Franz Boas, in Sixth Annual Report, Bureau of Ethnology,
Washington, D. C., 1888, p. 611.)</p>

<span class="smaller">THE COMMEMORATIVE CHARACTER OF RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The opinion expressed above concerning the commemorative character
of religious festivals echoes that which Godfrey Higgins enunciated
several generations ago. The learned author of “Anacalypsis”
says that festivals “accompanied with dancing and music” ...
“were established to keep in recollection victories or other important
events.” (Higgins’ “Anacalypsis,” London, 1810, vol. ii. p. 424.)
He argues the subject at some length on pages 424-426, but the above
is sufficient for the present purpose.</p>

<p>“In the religious rites of a people I should expect to find the earliest
of their habits and customs.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 15.)</p>

<p>Applying the above remark to the Zuñi dance, it may be interpreted
as a dramatic pictograph of some half-forgotten episode in tribal history.
To strengthen this view by example, let us recall the fact that
the army of Crusaders under Peter the Hermit was so closely beleaguered
by the Moslems in Nicomedia in Bithynia that they were compelled
to drink their own urine. We read the narrative set out in
cold type. The Zuñis would have transmitted a record of the event
by a dramatic representation which time would incrust with all the
veneration that religion could impart.</p>

<p>The authority for the above statement in regard to the Crusaders is
to be found in Purchas, “Pilgrims,” lib. 8, cap. 1, p. 1191. Neither
Gibbon nor Michaud expresses this fact so clearly, but each speaks of
the terrible sufferings which decimated the undisciplined hordes
of Walter the Penniless and Peter, and reduced the survivors to
cannibalism.</p>

<p>The urine of horses was drunk by the people of Crotta while
besieged by Metellus.—(See, in Montaigne’s Essays, “On Horses,”
cap. xlviii.; see also, in Harington, “Ajax”—“Ulysses upon Ajax,”
p. 42.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>Shipwrecked English seamen drank human urine for want of water.
(See in Purchas, vol. iv. p. 1188.) In the year 1877 Captain Nicholas
Nolan, Tenth Cavalry, while scouting with his troop after hostile
Indians on the Staked Plains of Texas, was lost; and as supplies became
exhausted, the command was reduced to living for several days
on the blood of their horses and their own urine, water not being
discovered in that vicinity.—(See Hammersley’s Record of Living
Officers of the United States Army.)</p>

<p>History is replete with examples of the same general character;
witness the sieges of Jerusalem, Numantia, Ghent, the famine in
France under Louis XIV., and many others.</p>

<h3>THE GENERALLY SACRED CHARACTER OF DANCING.</h3>

<p>“Dancing was originally merely religious, intended to assist the memory
in retaining the sacred learning which originated previous to the
invention of letters. Indeed, I believe that there were no parts of the
rites and ceremonies of antiquity which were not adopted with a
view to keep in recollection the ancient learning before letters were
known.”—(Higgins’ “Anacalypsis,” vol. ii. p. 179.)</p>

<p>In one of the sieges of Samaria, it is recorded that “The fourth part
of a cab of dove’s dung sold for five pieces of silver.”—(2 Kings,
vi. 25.)</p>

<p>There is another interpretation of the meaning of this expression, not
so literal, which it is well to insert at this point.</p>

<p>“When Samaria was besieged, the town was a prey to all the horrors
of famine; hunger was so extreme that five pieces of silver was the
price given for a small measure (fourth part of a cab) of dove’s dung.
This seems, at first sight, ridiculous. But Bochart maintains very
plausibly that this name was then and is now given by the Arabs to a
species of vetch (<i>pois chiches</i>).”—(“Philosophy of Magic,” Eusebe
Salverte, New York, 1862, vol. i. p. 70.)</p>

<p>“The pulse called garbansos is believed by certain authors to be
the dove’s dung mentioned at the siege of Samaria; ... they have
likewise been taken for the pigeons’ dung mentioned at the siege of
Samaria. And, indeed, as the cicer is pointed at one end and acquires
an ash color in parching, the first of which circumstances answers to
the figure, the other to the usual color of pigeons’ dung, the supposition
is by no means to be disregarded.”—(“Shaw’s Travels in Barbary,”
in “Pinkerton’s Voyages,” London, 1814, vol. xv. p. 600.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<h3>FRAY DIEGO DURAN’S ACCOUNT OF THE MEXICAN FESTIVALS.</h3>

<p>All that Higgins believed was believed and asserted by the Dominican
missionary Diego Duran. Duran complains bitterly that the unwise
destruction of the ancient Mexican pictographs and all that explained
the religion of the natives left the missionaries in ignorance as to what
was religion and what was not. The Indians, taking advantage of this,
mocked and ridiculed the dogmas and ceremonies of the new creed in
the very face of its expounders, who still lacked a complete mastery of
the language of the conquered. The Indians never could be induced
to admit that they still adhered to their old superstitions, or that they
were boldly indulging in their religious observances; many times,
says the shrewd old chronicler, it would appear that they were merely
indulging in some pleasant pastime, while they were really engaged in
idolatry; or that they were playing games, when truly they were casting
lots for future events before the priest’s eyes; or that they were
subjecting themselves to penitential discipline, when they were sacrificing
to their gods. This remark applied to all that they did. In
dances, in baths, in markets, in singing their songs, in their dramas
(the word is “<i>comedia</i>,” a comedy, but a note in the margin of the
manuscript says that probably this ought to be “<i>comida</i>,” food, or
dinner, or feast), in sowing, in reaping, in putting away the harvest in
their granaries, even in tilling the ground, in building their houses,
in their funerals, in their burials, in marriages, in the birth of children,
into everything they did entered idolatry and superstition.</p>

<p>“Parece muchas veces pensar que estan haciendo placer y estan
idolatrando; y pensar que estan jugando y estan echando suertes de
los sucesos delante de nuestros ojos y no los entendemos y pensamos
que se disciplinan y estanse sacrificando.</p>

<p>“Y asi erraron mucho los que con bueno celo (pero no con mucha
prudencia), quemaron y destruyeron al principio todas las pinturas de
antiguallas que tenian; pues, nos dejaron tan sin luz que delante de
nuestros ojos idolatran y no los entendemos.</p>

<p>“En los mitotes, en los baños, en los mercados, y en los cantares que
cantan lamentando sus Dioses y sus Señores Antiguos, en las comedias,
en los banquetes, y en el diferenciar en el de ellas, en todo se halla
supersticion é idolátria; en el sembrar, en el coger, en el encerrar en
los troges, hasta en el labrar la tierra y edificar las casas; pues en los
mortuorios y entierros, y en los casamientos y en los nacimientos de
los niños, especialmente si era hijo de algun Señor; eran estrañas las<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
ceremonias que se le hacian; y donde todo se perfeccionaba era en la
celebration de las fiestas; finalmente, en todo mezclaban supersticion é
idolatria; hasta en irse á bañarse al rio los viejos, puesto escrúpulo á
la republica sino fuese habiendo precedido tales y tales ceremonias;
todo lo cual nos es encubierto por el gran secreto que tienen.”—(Diego
Duran, lib. 2, concluding remarks.)</p>

<p>Fray Diego Duran, a Fray Predicador of the Dominican order, says,
at the end of his second volume, that it was finished in 1581.</p>

<p>The very same views were held by Father Geronimo Boscána, a Franciscan,
who ministered for seventeen years to the Indians of California.
Every act of an Indian’s life was guided by religion.—(See “Chinigchinich,”
included in A. A. Robinson’s “California,” New York, 1850.)</p>

<p>The Apaches have dances in which the prehistoric condition of the
tribe is thus represented; so have the Mojaves and the Zuñis; while
in the snake dance of the Moquis and the sun dance of the Sioux
the same faithful adherence to traditional costume and manners is
apparent.</p>

<h3>THE URINE DANCE OF THE ZUÑIS MAY CONSERVE A TRADITION OF
THE TIME WHEN VILE ALIMENT WAS IN USE.</h3>

<p>The Zuñi dance may therefore not improperly be considered among
other points of view, under that which suggests a commemoration of
the earliest life of this people, when vile aliment of every kind may have
been in use through necessity.</p>

<p>An examination of evidence will show that foods now justly regarded
as noxious were once not unknown to nations of even greater development
than any as yet attained by the Rio Grande Pueblos.</p>

<p>Necessity was not always the inciting motive; frequently religious
frenzy was responsible for orgies of which only vague accounts and still
vaguer explanations have come down to us.</p>

<p>The religious examples will be adduced at a later moment, as will
those in which human or animal excreta have been employed in ordeals
and punishments, terrestrial and supernal.</p>

<p>So long as the lines of investigation are included within civilized
limits, the instances noticed very properly fall under the classification of
mania and of abnormal appetite; and the latter, in turn, may be subdivided
into the two classes of the innate and the acquired, the second
of which has presented a constant decrease since physicians have rejected
such disgusting remedial agents from the Materia Medica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>That both human ordure and urine have been, and that they may
still to a limited extent be, added by the rustic population of portions
of Europe to the contents of love-philters is a fact established beyond
peradventure; and that the followers of the Grand Lama of Thibet
stand accused, on what has the semblance of excellent authority, of obtaining
from their priests the egestæ of that potent hierarch and adopting
them as condiments, food, charms, amulets, and talismans, as well
as internal medicines, will be fully stated in the chapters devoted
to that purpose.</p>

<p>Schurig gives numerous examples of the eating of human and animal
excrement by epileptics, by maniacs, by chlorotic young women, or by
women in pregnancy, by children who had defiled their beds and
dreading detection swallowed the evidences of their guilt, and finally
by men and women with abnormal appetites.—(See Schurig, “Chylologia,”
Dresden, 1725, pp. 45, 81, 84, 780-782.)</p>

<p>Burton relates the story of a young German girl, Catherine Gualter,
in 1571, as told by Cornelius Gemma, who vomited, “among other
things, pigeons’ dung and goose-dung.” She was apparently a victim
of hysteria, and in her paroxysms had previously swallowed all manner
of objectionable matter.—(See “Anatomy of Melancholy,” edition of
London, 1806, vol. i. p. 76.)</p>

<p>“On a vu, surtout dans les hôpitaux, des femmes se faire un jeu
d’avaler clandestinement leurs urines à mesure qu’elles les rendaient, et
essayer faire croire qu’elles n’en rendaient point du tout.”—(Personal
letter to Captain Bourke from Mr. Frank Rede Fowke, dated Department
of Science and Art, South Kensington Museum, London, S. W.,
June 18, 1888.)</p>

<span class="smaller">HUMAN EXCREMENT USED IN FOOD BY THE INSANE AND OTHERS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The subject of excrement-eating among insane persons has engaged
the attention of medical experts. H. B. Obersteiner, in a communication
to the “Psychiatrisches Centralblatt,” Wien, 1871, vol. iii. p. 95,
informs that periodical that Dr. A. Erlenmeyer, Jr., induced by a lecture
delivered by Professor Lang in 1872, had prepared a tabulated
series of data embodying the results of his observations upon the existence
of coprophagy among insane persons. He found that one in
a hundred of persons suffering from mental diseases indulged in this
abnormal appetite; the majority of these were men. No particular
relation could be established between excrement-eating and Onanism;
and no deleterious effect upon the alimentary organs was detected.</p>

<p>“In pathological reversion of type, due to cerebral disease, there are
certain stages in some forms of mental disease in which some of the
actions to which you refer are not uncommon.”—(Personal letter to
Captain Bourke from Surgeon John S. Billings, U. S. Army, in charge
of the Army Medical Museum, dated Washington, D. C., April 23,
1888.)</p>

<p>“A boy of four years old had fouled in bed; but being much afraid
of whipping, he ate his own dung, yet he could not blot the sign out
of the sheets; wherefore, being asked by threatenings, he at length
tells the chance. But being asked of its savor, he said it was of a
stinking and somewhat sweet one.... A noble little virgin, being very
desirous of her salvation, eats her own dung, and was weak and sick.
She was asked of what savor it was, and she answered it was of a
stinking and a waterishly sweet one.” These examples Von Helmont
says were personally known to him, as was that of the painter of
Brussels who, going mad, subsisted for twenty-three days on his own
excrements.—(See Von Helmont’s “Oritrika” (English translation),
London, 1662, pp. 211, 212. Von Helmont’s work is a folio of 1161
pages.)</p>

<p>A French lady was in the habit of carrying about her pulverized
human excrements, which she ate, and would afterwards lick her fingers.

Paullini also gives the instance of the painter of Brussels already cited
on preceding page.</p>

<p>In this curious book, full of learning and research, there are citations
from more than three hundred authorities, some of them, of
course, merely obscene and not coming within the purview of these
notes, but others, as may be readily understood from reading the extracts
taken from them, of the highest value in a scientific sense.
Schurig gives an instance of voracity in which a certain glutton, after
consuming all other food in sight, was wont to satisfy himself with
urine and excrement: “Et si panes deerant, sua ipse excrementa
comedebat et lotium bibebat.” (Schurig, “Chylologia,” Dresden,
1725, p. 52.) A case is given of a patient who having once experienced
the beneficial effects of mouse-dung in some complaint, became
a confirmed mouse-dung eater, and was in the habit of picking it
up from the floor of his house before the servants could sweep it away.—(See
Schurig, “Chylologia,” Dresden, 1725, p. 823 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The enceinte wife of a farmer in the town of Hassfort, on the Main,
ate the excrements of her husband, warm and smoking.—(See Christian
Franz Paullini, “Dreck Apothek,” edition of Frankfort, 1696,

Leipsig. 1694, on page 212 of this volume.)</p>

<p>The letter in question was sent her by her aunt, the wife of the
Elector of Hanover, and may serve to give an idea of the boldness of
the opinions entertained by the ladies of high rank in that era, and the
coarseness with which they expressed them:—</p>

<p>The following appeared in an article headed “The Last Cholera
Epidemic in Paris,” in the “General Homœopathic Journal,” vol.
cxiii., page 15, 1886: “The neighbors of an establishment famous
for its excellent bread, pastry, and similar products of luxury, complained
again and again of the disgusting smells which prevailed
therein and which penetrated into their dwellings. The appearance
of cholera finally lent force to these complaints, and the sanitary inspectors
who were sent to investigate the matter found that there was
a connection between the water-closets of these dwellings and the reservoir
containing the water used in the preparation of the bread. This
connection was cut off at once, but the immediate result thereof was
a perceptible deterioration of the quality of the bread. Chemists have
evidently no difficulty in demonstrating that water impregnated with
‘extract of water-closet,’ has the peculiar property of causing dough
to rise particularly fine, thereby imparting to bread the nice appearance
and pleasant flavor which is the principal quality of luxurious
bread.”—(Personal letter from Dr. Gustav Jaeger, Stuttgart, Germany.

<span class="smaller">THE EMPLOYMENT OF EXCREMENT IN FOOD BY SAVAGE TRIBES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The very earliest accounts of the Indians of Florida and Texas refer
to the use of such aliment. Cabeza de Vaca, one of the survivors
of the ill-fated expedition of Panfilo de Narvaez, was a prisoner
among various tribes for many years, and finally, accompanied by
three comrades as wretched as himself, succeeded in traversing the
continent, coming out at Culiacan, on the Pacific Coast, in 1536. His
narrative says that the “Floridians,” “for food, dug roots, and that
they ate spiders, ants’ eggs, worms, lizards, salamanders, snakes, earth,
wood, the dung of deer, and many other things.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The same account,
given in Purchas’s “Pilgrims” (vol. iv. lib. 8, cap. 1, sec. 2, p. 1512)
expresses it that “they also eat earth, wood, and whatever they can
get; the dung of wild beasts.” These remarks may be understood as
applying to all tribes seen by this early explorer east of the Rocky
mountains.</p>

<p>Gómara identifies this loathsome diet with a particular tribe, the
“Yaguaces” of Florida. “They eat spiders, ants, worms, lizards of two
kinds, snakes, earth, wood, and ordure of all kinds of wild animals.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The California Indians were still viler. The German Jesuit, Father
Jacob Baegert, speaking of the Lower Californians (among whom he
resided continuously from 1748 to 1765), says:—</p>

<p>“They eat the seeds of the pitahaya (giant cactus) which have
passed off undigested from their own stomachs; they gather their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
excrement, separate the seeds from it, roast, grind, and eat them,
making merry over the loathsome meal.” And again: “In the mission
of Saint Ignatius, ... there are persons who will attach a piece
of meat to a string and swallow it and pull it out again a dozen times
in succession, for the sake of protracting the enjoyment of its taste.”—(Translation
of Dr. Charles F. Rau, in Annual Report, Smithsonian
Institution, 1866, p. 363.)</p>

<p>A similar use of meat tied to a string is understood to have once
been practised by European sailors for the purpose of teasing green
comrades suffering from the agonies of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>(Fuegians.) “One of them immediately coughed up a piece of blubber
which he had been eating and gave it to another, who swallowed it
with much ceremony and with a peculiar guttural noise.”—(“Voyage
of the Adventure and Beagle,” London, 1839, vol. i. p. 315.)</p>

<p>The same information is to be found in Clavigero (“Historia de la
Baja California,” Mexico, 1852, p. 24), and in H. H. Bancroft’s “Native
Races of the Pacific Slope,” vol. i. p. 561; both of whom derive from
Father Baegert. Orozco y Berra also has the story; but he adds that
oftentimes numbers of the Californians would meet and pass the delicious
tid-bit from mouth to mouth.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Castañeda alludes to the Californians as a race of naked savages,
who ate their own excrement.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Indians of North America, according to Harmon, “boil the
buffalo paunch with much of its dung adhering to it,”—a filthy mode
of cooking which in itself would mean little, since it can be paralleled
in almost all tribes. But in another paragraph the same
author says: “Many consider a broth made by means of the dung of
the cariboo and the hare to be a dainty dish” (Harmon’s “Journal,”
etc., Andover, 1820, p. 324).<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>The Abbé Domenech asserts the same of the bands near Lake
Superior: “In boiling their wild rice to eat, they mix it with the excrement
of rabbits,—a delicacy appreciated by the epicures among
them” (Domenech, “Deserts,” vol. ii. p. 311).</p>

<p>Of the negroes of Guinea an old authority relates that they “ate
filthy, stinking elephant’s and buffalo’s flesh, wherein there is a thousand
maggots, and many times stinks like carrion. They eat raw
dogge guts, and never seethe nor roast them” (De Bry, Ind. Orient. in
Purchas’s “Pilgrims,” vol. ii. p. 905). And another says that the
Mosagueys make themselves a “pottage with milk and fresh dung of
kine, which, mixed together and heat at the fire, they drinke, saying it
makes them strong” (Purchas, lib. 9, cap. 12, sec. 4, p. 1555).</p>

<p>The Peruvians ate their meat and fish raw; but nothing further is
said by Gómara. “Comen crudo la carne y el pescado” (Gómara,
“Hist. de las Indias,” p. 234.)</p>

<p>The savages of Australia “make a sweet and luscious beverage by
mixing taarp with water. Taarp is the excrement of a small green
beetle, wherein the larvæ thereof are deposited.”—(“The Aborigines
of Victoria and Riverina,” P. Beveridge, Melbourne, 1889, p. 126; received
through the kindness of the Royal Society of Sydney, New
South Wales, T. B. Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>“One of them (Snakes), who had seized about nine feet of the entrails,
was chewing it at one end, while with his hand he was diligently
clearing his way by discharging the contents of the other. It was indeed
impossible to see these wretches ravenously feeding on the filth of
animals, and the blood streaming from their mouths, without deploring
how nearly the condition of savages approaches that of the brute creation.”—(Lewis
and Clark, quoted by Spencer, “Descriptive Sociology:
‘Snakes.’”)</p>

<p>“Some authors have said that all the Hottentots devour the entrails
of beasts, uncleansed of their filth and excrements, and that, whether
sound or rotten, they consider them as the greatest delicacies in the
world; but this is not true. I have always found that when they
had entrails to eat they turned and stripped them of their filth and
washed them in clear water.”—(“Peter Kolben’s Voyage to the Cape of
Good Hope,” in Knox’s “Voyages and Travels,” London, 1777, vol. ii.
p. 385.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Atkinson declined to dine with a party of Kirghis who had killed a
sheep, “having seen the entrails put into the pan after undergoing but
a very slight purification.”—(“Siberia,” T. W. Atkinson, New York,
1865, p. 219, and again p. 433.)</p>

<p>“The entrails of animals and other refuse matter thrown overboard
from the English ships is eagerly collected and eaten by the Cochi-Chinese,
whom Mr. White even accuses of having a predilection for
filth.”—(“Encyc. of Geography,” Philadelphia, 1845, vol. ii. p. 397,
article “Farther India.”)</p>

<p>(Arabs of the Red Sea.) “The water of Dobelew and Irwee tasted
strongly of musk, from the dung of the goats and antelopes, and the
smell before you drink it is more nauseous than the taste.”—(“Travels
to discover the Source of the Nile,” James Bruce, Dublin, 1790,
vol. i. p. 367.)</p>

<p>From thus enduring water polluted with the excrements of animals
to drinking beverages to which urine has been purposely added, as Sir
Samuel Baker and Colonel Chaille Long show to have been the custom
of the negroes near Gondokoro with their milk, is but a very small
step.</p>

<p>Chaille Long relates that in Central Africa he and his men were
obliged to drink water which was a mixture of the excrements of the
rhinoceros and the elephant (see “Central Africa,” New York, 1877,
p. 86). Livingston tells us that the Africans living along the banks of
the Zambesi are careful not to drink except from springs or wells which
they dig in the sand. “During nearly nine months in the year ordure
is deposited around countless villages along the thousands of miles
drained by the Zambesi. When the heavy rains come down and sweep
the vast fetid accumulation into the torrents the water is polluted with
filth” (“Zambesi,” London, 1865, p. 181).</p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey reports that he has seen, while among the
Ponkas, “a woman and a child devour the entrails of a beef, with the
contents” (personal letter to Captain Bourke).</p>

<p>Réclus says that the Eastern Inuit eat excrement. “Ils ne reculent
pas devant les intestins de l’ours, pas même devant ses excréments, et
se jettent avec avidité sur la nourriture mal digérée qu’ils retirent du
ventre des rennes” (“Les Primitifs,” Paris, 1885, pp. 31, 32). “Les
Ygarrotes des Philippines, qui versent comme sauce à leur viande crue
le jus des fientes d’un buffle fraîchement abattu” (idem, p. 31).</p>

<p>The tribes of Angola, West Africa, cook the entrails of deer without
removing the contents; this is for the purpose of getting a flavor, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the excrement itself is not eaten (“Muhongo,” interpretation by Rev.
Mr. Chatelain).</p>

<p>The Thibetan monk was not to eat entrails. “Ne pas manger des
tripes” (“Pratimoksha Sutra,” W. W. Rockhill, Soc. Asiatique, Paris,
1885.)</p>

<p>(Tunguses of Siberia.) “They eat up every part of the animal
which they kill, not throwing away even the impurities of the bowels,
with which they make a sort of black pudding by a mixture of blood
and fat.”—(Gavrila Sarytschew, in Phillips’s “Voyages,” London,
1807, vol. v.)</p>

<p>Natives of Eastern Siberia “ate with avidity the entrails of the seal
without cleaning in the least the partly digested food from the intestines,
the ordure of the seal being as offensive to civilized man as
the fæces of men or dogs.”—(Personal letter from Chief Engineer
Melville, U. S. Navy, to Captain Bourke.)</p>

<p>The Aleuts and Indians from the extreme northern coast of America
with Melville’s party displayed the same appetite for the half-digested
contents of the paunches of the seals killed by them. This appetite
was not due to lack of food, as Melville takes care to explain. At
another time he detected his “natives” in the act of eating “plentifully,
though covertly, of the droppings of the reindeer” (idem).</p>

<span class="smaller">URINE IN HUMAN FOOD.</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>CHINOOK OLIVES.</h3>

<p>The addition of urine to human food is mentioned by various
writers. Speaking of the Chinooks, Paul Kane describes a delicacy
manufactured by some of the Indians among whom he travelled,
and called by him “Chinook Olives.” They were nothing more
nor less than acorns soaked for five months in human urine (see Kane,
“Artist’s Wanderings in North America,” London, 1859, p. 187).
Spencer copies Kane’s story in his “Descriptive Sociology,” article
“Chinooks.”</p>

<p>“In Queensland, near Darlington, there is a tract of country covered
with a peculiar species of pine, yielding an edible nut of which the
natives are extremely fond.... The men would form large clay pans
in the soil, into which they would urinate; they would then collect
an abundance of these seeds and steep them in the urine. A fermentation
took place, and all the seeds were devoured greedily, the effect
being to cause a temporary madness among the men,—in fact a perfect
delirium tremens. On these occasions it was dangerous for any one
to approach them. The liquid was not used in any way.”—(Personal
letter from John F. Mann, Esq., Neutral Bay, Sydney, New South
Wales.)</p>

<p>This account not only recalls the story told by the artist Kane in
the preceding paragraph, but establishes the fact that in Australia
there is something with a marvellous resemblance to the Ur-Orgie of
the people of Siberia.</p>

<p>Chief Engineer George W. Melville, U. S. Navy, author of “In the
Lena Delta,” has had much experience with the natives of Northern
Siberia, among whom it was his misfortune to be cast away. In a personal
letter to Captain Bourke he states that he observed several instances
of Siberian women drinking their own or their neighbor’s
freshly voided urine. Once, in Sutke Harbor, Saint Lawrence Bay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
near East Cape, when he “frowned at their unclean and unseemly act,
they seemed very much amused, and after a moment’s talk, one of
them voided her urine and another drank it, both being very much
diverted by my disgust.” He further relates that when his “natives”
could not obtain from his limited supplies all the alcohol they wanted,
they made a mixture of alcohol and their own urine in equal parts and
drank it down.</p>

<p>“On the morning of the 8th of May, while struggling with an attack
of fever, I received a visit from Gilmoro, who brought me a gourd
of milk as an expression of gratitude for saving him at an opportune
moment his position. Burning with fever, I drained at one draught a
goblet full of the foaming liquid ere the sense of taste could detect the
nauseous mixture; my stomach, however, quickly rebelled, and rejected
in violent retching the unsavory potion, seven eighths of which were
simply the urine of the cow!—a practice, by the by, common to all
Central Africans, who never drink milk unless thus mixed.”</p>

<p>“This fetish and superstition thereby insures protection for the cow
here, as on the Bahr-el Abiad, mysteriously connected with the unknown,—a
shadow possibly of the old Egyptian worship.”—(“Central
Africa,” Chaille Long, New York, 1877, p. 70.)</p>

<h3>URINE IN BREAD-MAKING.</h3>

<p>A comparatively late writer says of the Moquis of Arizona: “They
are not as clean in their housekeeping as the Navajoes, and it is hinted
that they sometimes mix their meal with chamber-lye for these festive
occasions; but I did not know that until I talked with Mormons who
visited them” (J. H. Beadle, “Western Wilds,” Cincinnati, Ohio, 1878,
p. 279).</p>

<p>Beadle lived and ate with the Moquis for a number of days. This
story, coming from the Mormons, may refer to some imperfectly understood
ceremonial.</p>

<p>There is some ground for suspecting that urine may have been employed
by bakers in Europe prior to the introduction of the “barm”
or ale yeast as a ferment. Ammonia is at the present time made use
of by the Germans in this industry (see page 32).</p>

<p>It is possible that the following account of the manner of eating
blubber among the Patagonians may mean that urine was poured over
it: “He put the same piece on the fire again, and after an addition to
it too offensive to mention, again sucked it” (“Voyage of the Adventure
and Beagle,” London, 1839, vol. i. p. 343).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>As bearing upon the ingestion of human excreta, which would
seem to excite a natural feeling of revulsion, the following statement
may have some significance: Spencer Saint John, in his “Life in the
Far East,” London, 1842, after describing a head feast among the
Dyaks, says that, after certain preliminary rites and amusements,
“they commence eating and drinking ... an extraordinary accumulation,—fowls
roasted with their feathers on, eggs black with age,
decayed fruit, rice of all colors and kinds, strong-smelling fish almost
approaching a state of rottenness, and their drink having the appearance
and thickness of curds, in which they mix pepper and other ingredients.
It has a sickening effect upon them, and they swallow it more
as a duty than because they relish it.”</p>

<p>Evidently nastiness is an object, since “before they have added any
extraneous matter” this drink “is not unpleasant, having something
the taste of spruce-beer” (p. 66).</p>

<p>If the ceremony in question partakes of the nature of a sacrifice,—which
is not at all certain from the text, in which it is described as an
“entertainment,” but which appears probable from its being connected
with the organization and representation of the tribe and from its relation
to head-hunting,—then it may be assumed that the spoiled food
and nauseous drink are perfectly natural features, which have their
counterparts in many places.</p>

<p>As a rule, the more painful, costly, unnatural, and disgusting a rite
is, the more essentially sacrificial is its character,—for obvious
reasons.</p>

<p>Von Stralenburg says of the Koraks that they use the same tubs as
urinals and for the purpose of holding drinking water (see citation on
page 152 of this volume).</p>

<h3>HUMAN ORDURE EATEN BY EAST INDIAN FANATICS.</h3>

<p>Speaking of the remnants of the Hindu sect of the Aghozis, an English
writer observes:—</p>

<p>“In proof of their indifference to worldly objects they eat and drink
whatever is given to them, even ordure and carrion. They smear their
bodies also with excrement, and carry it about with them in a wooden
cup, or skull, either to swallow it, if by so doing they can get a few pice,
or to throw it upon the persons or into the houses of those who refuse
to comply with their demands.”—(“Religious Sects of the Hindus,”
in “Asiatic Researches,” vol. xvii. p. 205, Calcutta, India, 1832.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Another writer confirms the above. The Abbé Dubois says that the
Gurus, or Indian priests, sometimes, as a mark of favor, present to
their disciples “the water in which they had washed their feet, which
is preserved and sometimes drunk by those who receive it” (Dubois,
“People of India,” London, 1817, p. 64). This practice, he tells us,
is general among the sectaries of Siva, and is not uncommon with many
of the Vishnuites in regard to their vashtuma. “Neither is it the most
disgusting of the practices that prevail in that sect of fanatics, as they
are under the reproach of eating as a hallowed morsel the very ordure
that proceeds from their Gurus, and swallowing the water with which
they have rinsed their mouths or washed their faces, with many other
practices equally revolting to nature” (idem, p. 71).</p>

<p>Again, on page 331, Dubois alludes to the Gymnosophists “or
naked Samyasis of India ... eating human excrement, without showing
the slightest symptom of disgust.”</p>

<p>As bearing not unremotely upon this point, the author wishes to say
that in his personal notes and memoranda can be found references to
one of the medicine-men of the Sioux who assured his admirers that
everything about him was “medicine,” even his excrement, which
could be transmuted into copper cartridges.</p>

<p>“I was informed that vast numbers of Shordrus drank the water in
which a Brahmin has dipped his foot, and abstain from food in the
morning till this ceremony be over. Some persons do this every
day.... Persons may be seen carrying a small quantity of water in a
cup and entreating the first Brahmin they see to put his toe in it....
Some persons keep water thus sanctified in their houses.”—(Ward,
quoted by Southey in his “Commonplace Book,” London, 1849, 2d
series, p. 521.)</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ORDURE OF THE GRAND LAMA OF THIBET.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>That the same disgusting veneration was accorded the person of
the Grand Lama of Thibet, was once generally believed. Maltebrun
asserts it in positive terms: “It is a certain fact that the refuse
excreted from his body is collected with sacred solicitude, to be employed
as amulets and infallible antidotes to disease.”</p>

<p>And, quoting from Pallas, book 1, p. 212, he adds: “Il est hors de
doute que le contenu de sa chaise percée est dévotement recueilli; les
parties solides sont distribuées comme des amulettes qu’on porte au
cou; le liquide est pris intérieurement comme une médécine infaillible.”—(Maltebrun,
Universal Geography, article “Thibet,” vol. ii.
lib. 45, American edition, Philadelphia, 1832.)</p>

<p>The Abbé Huc denies this assertion: “The Talé Lama is venerated
by the Thibetans and the Mongols like a divinity. The influence he
exercises over the Buddhist population is truly astonishing; but still
it is going too far to say that his excrements are carefully collected
and made into amulets, which devotees inclose in pouches and carry
around their necks.”—(Huc, “Travels in Tartary, Thibet, and
China,” London, 1849, vol. ii. p. 198.)</p>

<h3>HUC AND DUBOIS COMPARED.</h3>

<p>Huc was a keen and observing traveller; he was well acquainted
with the languages and customs of the Mongolians; his tour into
Thibet was replete with incident, and his narrative never flags in
interest. Still, in Thibet he was only a traveller; the upper classes
of the Buddhist priesthood looked upon him with suspicion. The
lower orders of priesthood and people did seem to consider him as a
Lama from the far East, but he did not succeed in gaining the confidence
of the Thibetans to the extent possessed by Dubois among the
Brahminical sects. The history of the latter author is a peculiar one:
A French priest, driven from his native land by the excesses of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
revolution, he took refuge in India, devoting himself for nearly twenty
years to missionary labor among the people, with whom he became so
thoroughly identified that when his notes appeared they were published
at the expense of the British East India Company, and distributed
among its officials as a text-book.</p>

<p>While it is possible to consult earlier authorities, the determination
of this matter should not be allowed to remain in controversy. The
first Europeans known to have penetrated to Thibet (or Barantola, as
they called it) were the Jesuits Grueber and Dorville, who, returning
from China to Europe, walked through Thibet, and down through
India to the sea-coast. This was in 1661; another member of the
same order, Father Andrade, claimed to have succeeded in the same
perilous undertaking at an earlier date (1621), but the names of the
cities he visited proves that he did not get beyond what is now known
as Afghanistan, at the foot of the mountains bordering on Thibet.
While Grueber and Dorville were making their journey, or not many
years after, Father Gerbillon, also a Jesuit, had taken up his abode
among the nomadic Tartars, acquiring an influence with them of
which the Emperor of China was glad to avail himself in emergencies.
None of these travellers claimed to have seen the Grand Lama in
person.</p>

<p>“Grueber assures us that the grandees of the kingdom are very
anxious to procure the excrements of this divinity (i. e., the Grand
Lama), which they usually wear about their necks as relics. In another
place he says that the Lamas make a great advantage by the
large presents they receive for helping the grandees to some of his
excrements, or urine; for, by wearing the first about their necks, and
mixing the latter with their victuals, they imagine themselves to be
secure against all bodily infirmities. In confirmation of this, Gerbillon
informs us that the Mongols wear his excrements, pulverized, in
little bags about their necks, as precious relics, capable of preserving
them from all misfortunes, and curing them of all sorts of distempers.
When this Jesuit was on his second journey into Western Tartary, a
deputy from one of the principal lamas offered the emperor’s uncle a
certain powder, contained in a little packet of very white paper, neatly
wrapped up in a scarf of very white taffety; but that prince told him
that as it was not the custom of the Manchews to make use of such
things, he durst not receive it. The author took this powder to be
either some of the Great Lama’s excrements, or the ashes of something
that had been used by him.”—(“A Description of Thibet,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
in Pinkerton’s “Voyages and Travels,” London, 1814, vol. vii. p.
559).</p>

<p>“Grueber, in his late account of his return from China, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1661,
by way of Lassa, or Barantola, as Kircher calls it (see Kircher, China
Illustrata, part ii. c. 1), but Grueber himself Barantaka (where, he
saith, no Christian hath never been) ... above all, he wondered at
their pope (the Grand Lama of Thibet), to whom they give divine
honors, and worship his very excrements, and put them up in golden
boxes, as a most excellent remedy against all mischiefs.”—(Stillingfleet,
“Defence of Discourse concerning Idolatry in Church of Rome,”
London, 1676, pp. 116-120, quoted by H. T. Buckle, in his “Commonplace
Book,” p. 79, vol. ii. of his Works, London, 1872).</p>

<p>Turner, “Embassy to Thibet,” London, 1806, makes no reference to
the use of the excrements of the Grand Lama.</p>

<p>Friar Odoric, of Pordenone, visited L’hassa, Thibet, between <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1316 and 1330 (see Markham’s edition of Bogle’s “Thibet,” London,
1879, p. 46). Markham believes that the Jesuit Antonio Andrada,
“in 1624,” whom he styles “an undaunted missionary,” “found his
way over the lofty passes to Rudok,” “climbed the terrific passes
to the source of the Ganges, and eventually, after fearful sufferings,
reached the shores of the sacred lake of Mansorewar, the source of
the Sutlej.”—(Introduction to Bogle’s “Thibet,” London, 1879).</p>

<p>Warren Hastings speaks of the Thibetan priests of high degree,
the “Ku-tchuck-tus,” who, he says, “admit a superiority in the Dalai
Lama, so that his excrements are sold as charms, at great price, among
all the Tartar tribes of this religion.”—(“Memorandum on Thibet,”
accompanying the instructions to Mr. Bogle, the first English embassador
to that country. See in Markham’s “Thibet,” London,
1879, p. 11.)</p>

<p>It is truly remarkable that neither in the report nor letters of
Bogle, nor in the notes of Manning, nor in the fragments of Grueber,
Desideri, nor Horace Della Penna, preserved in Markham’s “Thibet,”
can any allusion be found to the use of the excrements of the Grand
Lama in religion or medicine.</p>

<p>“Les grands du royaume” (i. e., of Barantola), “recherchent fort
les excréments de cette divinité” (i. e., Lamacongiu). “Ils les portent
ordinairement à leur col comme des reliques.”—(“Voyage de P.
Grueber à Chine,” taken from Conversations with P. Grueber. See,
in Thévenot, vol. ii., “Relations de Divers Voyages curieux,” Melchisédec
Thevenot, Paris, 1696, vol. ii.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Several authorities from whom much was expected are absolutely
silent.</p>

<p>No mention is to be found in Rubruquis of any use of human ordure
or urine among the Tartars among whom he travelled; all that he says
is that they baked their bread on cow-dung. This monk, a Franciscan,
was sent by King Louis IX. (Saint Louis), of France, on a mission to
the Grand Khan of Tartary in 1253, in the execution of which office
he travelled for thousands of miles through their territory. In Pinkerton
it is said: “The travels of Rubruquis are equally astonishing
in whatever light they are considered. Take them with respect to
length, and they extend upwards of five thousand miles one way and
nearly six thousand another.”—(Vol. vii. p. 96.)</p>

<p>During such a long journey he should have been able to notice
much, but we are to bear in mind that the manners of the Tartars of
the Grand Khan were at that time somewhat modified by contact with
European civilization, having among them many prisoners, as Rubruquis
points out, who officiated as artificers, while, on the other hand,
we know that the monk was thoroughly ignorant of all their dialects.
Marco Polo, who lived among the Tartars about the same time, says:
“But now the Tartars are mixed and confounded, and so are their
fashions.”—(Marco Polo, “Travels,” in Pinkerton’s “Voyages,” London,
1814, vol. vii. p. 124.)</p>

<p>Du Halde, although he gives an account of Thibet in his fourth volume,
and seems to be familiar with all the works on that country,
mentioning Fathers Grueber and Dorville, yet makes no allusion to
the use of the excrements of the Grand Lama as amulets or internally.
(See Du Halde’s “History of China,” London, 1736.) The fault may
lie with his translator in his zeal to “expurgate.”</p>

<p>Du Halde, a Jesuit missionary, had the assistance of all the members
of his order on duty in China; no less than a score or more aided
him; one of the number, Father Constancin, had a tour of service in
the Flowery Kingdom, as a missionary, of over thirty-two consecutive
years. During the generation preceding the appearance of Du Halde’s
work, the Jesuits had traversed China, Tartary, and Thibet. Tavernier,
whose opportunities for observation were excellent, asserted the
fact without ambiguity. The excrement of the Grand Lama was carefully
collected, dried, and in various ways used as a condiment, as a
snuff, and as a medicine.</p>

<p>“The Butan merchants assured Tavernier that they strew his ordure,
powdered, over their victuals.”—(Tavernier, “Travels,” vol. ii. p. 185.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Footnote to page 559, vol. vii. Pinkerton’s “Voyages and Travels,”
London, 1814.)</p>

<p>“Unde tantis venerationis indiciis ab omnibus colitur, ut beatum
ille se reputet, cui Lamarum (quod summis et pretiosis muneribus eum
in finem, non sine magno eorum lucro corrumpere solent) benignitate
aliquid ex naturalis secessus sordibus aut urina Magnæ Lamæ obtigerit.
Ex ejusmodi enim collo portatis, urina quoque cibis commixta.”—(Letter
of Father Adam Schall, S. J., “Aulæ Sino-Tartaricæ Supremi
Concilii Mandarinus,” in Thevenot, vol. ii.; Thevenot’s second volume
contains three short letters in Latin from Grueber to members of his
order, but in none is there any mention made of the ordure of the
Grand Lama.)</p>

<p>“There is no king in the world more feared and respected by his
subjects than the king of Butan; being in a manner adored by them....
The merchants assured Tavernier that those about the king preserve
his ordure, dry it, and reduce it to powder like snuff; that then
putting it into boxes, they go every market-day and present it to the
chief traders and farmers, who, recompensing them for their great
kindness, carry it home as a great rarity, and when they feast their
friends, strew it upon their meat. The author adds that two of them
showed him their boxes with the powder in them.”—(“A Description
of Thibet,” in Pinkerton, London, 1814, vol. vii. 567.)</p>

<p>The expression “king of Butan,” as used by Tavernier, means the
Grand Lama of Thibet. Tavernier’s statement has been accepted by
the most careful writers. “Indorum nonnullos, incolas scilicet regni
Boutan Homerda seu excrementis alvinis Regis sui siccatis et pulverisatis
cibos amicis et convivis suis appositos condire, refert Johannes
Baptista Tavernier, Itinerar. Indic. lib. 3, cap. 15, fol. m.” (Schurig,
“Chylologia,” Dresden, 1725, p. 775.) The same paragraph quoted
in the Bibliotheca Scatalogica, pages 29, 93, and 96, to which the
anonymous author adds, “et les Tartares et les Japonais tenaient en
pareille vénération la merde du grand lama et du Dairi.”</p>

<p>Rosinus Lentilius, in the Ephemeridum Physico-Medicorum, Leipsig,
1694, speaks of the Grand Lama of Thibet as held in such high veneration
by the devotees of his faith that his excrements, carefully collected,
dried, powdered, and sold at high prices by the priests, were
used as a sternutatory powder, to induce sneezing, and as a condiment
for their food, and as a remedy for all the graver forms of disease. He
quotes all this from Tavernier, and from Erasmus Franciscus, p. 1662.
There is also another citation from Tavernier, lib. 4, cap. 7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Nec de rege in Bantam, et summo Tangathani Regni Pontifice,
magno Lama, quos tanto in honore subditi habent ut merda eorum
magno studio collectam, et in pulverem comminutam (quam Brachmines
ære multo simplicibus divendunt) illi quidem scil. Boutamenses,
loco pulvere nasalis utantur, eoque lautius, victuri cibos
condiant hi vero scil. Tangat hani pro remedio longe presentissimo
ad varios desperatissimosque morbos habeant, aliisque medicamentis
admisceant, per sæpe memoratum” Tavernier, Itin. lib. 3, cap. 15, et
Franciscus, loc. cit. p. 1662.</p>

<p>References to “amulets” among the peoples of Tartary and Thibet
are made by nearly all travellers; but few seem to have considered it
worth while to determine of what these amulets were composed.</p>

<p>Fathers Grueber and Dorville say of the Kalmuck Tartar women,
“each with a charm about their necks to preserve them from dangers.”
These may have been ordure amulets of the Grand Lama.</p>

<p>In his condensation of the travels into Thibet of Fathers Grueber
and Dorville, Pinkerton omits what they had to say about these amulets,
although in another place, already cited, he refers to it.</p>

<p>(Burats of Siberia.) “I could observe no images among them except
some relics given them by their priests which they had from the Delay-Lama;
these are commonly hung up in a corner of their tents, and
sometimes about their necks, by way of an amulet to preserve them
from misfortunes.” (Bell, “Travels in Asia,” with the Russian Embassy
to China, in 1714, in Pinkerton, vol. vii. p. 347). Undoubtedly,
these were amulets of human ordure, etc., received from the
Grand Lama.</p>

<p>(Kalmucks of Siberia.) “Des pilules bénites qui viennent du Tibet
méritent attention; on les appelle Schalir. Les prêtres ne les donnent
qu’aux Kalmouks riches ou de distinction; ils les portent toujours sur
eux, et ils n’en font usage que dans les maladies graves où la mort
leur paraît presqu’inévitable. Ils prétendent que ces pilules servent à
distraire l’ame des choses temporelles, et à la sanctifier: elles sont
noires et de la grosseur d’un pois. Je presumai qu’elles renfermaient
de l’opium ou autre narcotique; mais on m’assure au contraire que
leur vertu était purgatif.”—(Voyages de Pallas, Paris, 1793, vol. i.
pp. 567, 568.)</p>

<p>(Mongolia.) “When famous lamas die and their bodies are burnt,
little white pills are reported as found among the ashes, and sold for
large sums to the devout, as being the concentrated virtue of the man
and possessing the power of insuring a happy future for him who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
swallows one near death. This is quite common. I heard of one man
who improved on this by giving out that these little pills were in the
habit of coming out through the skin of various parts of the body.
These pills, called Sharil, met with a ready sale, and then the man
himself reaped the reward of his virtue and did not allow all the profit
to go to his heir.”—(“Among the Mongols,” Rev. James Gilmour,
London, 1883, p. 231.)</p>

<p>This writer says that these sacred pills are white; another one,
already noted, describes them as black, while those obtained by the
author from Mr. W. W. Rockhill are red.</p>

<p>Vambéry instances one of the holy men of the Turkomans who,
after reciting a number of sacred verses, “used to place before him a
cup of water into which he spat at the end of each poem, and this composition
... was sold to the best bidder as a wonder-working medicine.”—(“Travels
in Central Asia,” New York, 1865, p. 272.)</p>

<p>Such use of the excrement of ecclesiastical dignitaries was indicated
in Oriental literature. In the “Arabian Nights” King Afrida says to
the Emirs, among other things, “‘And I purpose this night to sacre
you all with the Holy Incense.’ When the Emirs heard these words,
they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated
was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler
of the truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so
highly valued it, that the high-priests of the Greeks used to send it
to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps, after mixing it
with musk and ambergris; hearing of it, kings would pay a thousand
gold pieces for every dram, and they sent for and sought it to fumigate
brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the Great Kings were
wont to use a little of it as a Collyrium for the eyes, and as a remedy
in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite
(excrement) with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch would
not suffice for ten countries.”—(Burton’s edition, vol. ii. pp. 222,
223). In Burton’s Index this is called “Holy Merde.” Burton also
says, “The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the
Hindus; see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying
ox-dung and cow-urine to the king, who therewith anoints his face
and breast, etc. And, incredible to relate, this is still practised by the
Parsis, one of the most progressive and sharpest-witted of the Asiatic
races.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Rochefoucauld tells us that we ascribe to others the faults of which
we ourselves would be guilty, had we the opportunity. The Arabians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
no doubt were fully acquainted with just such customs; possibly, the
Greeks also.</p>

<p>The Kalmucks believe in spirits or genii called “Bourkans,” and in
a maleficent one known as “Erlik-khan.” They tell a story of three
of these “Bourkans,” one of them being Sakya-Muni: “Étant un
jour assis ensemble, firent leurs prières dans la plus grande ferveur,
ayant les yeux fermés, ainsi que cela se pratique chez les Kalmouks,
le génie infernal s’approche d’eux, et fit ses ordures dans la coupe
sacrée que les prêtres ont devant eux lorsqu’ils font la prière. Dès
que les dieux s’en aperçurent, ils tinrent conseil. Ils conclurent que
s’ils répandoient cette matière venimeuse dans les airs, ils féroient
périr tous les habitants de cet élément; et que s’ils la jétoient sur
la terre, ils féroient mourir tous les êtres vivans qui l’occupent. Ils
résolurent donc, pour le bien de l’humanité, de l’avaler. Sakya-Muni
eut pour sa part le fond de la coupe; le levain étoit si fort que son
visage devint tout bleu. C’est la raison pour laquelle on lui peint la
figure en bleu dans les images; ses idoles ont seulement le bonnet
vernissé en bleu.”—(Voyages de Pallas, Paris, 1793, vol. i. p. 548).</p>

<p>This is a lame explanation, invented by the Lamas after men had
become somewhat refined, and had begun to evince a repugnance to
these diabolical usages. Compare with the notes presented by Mr.
W. W. Rockhill, the Oriental scholar and Thibetan explorer, on p. 37.</p>

<p>The following is from a manuscript by Mr. W. W. Rockhill, entitled
“The Lamaist Ceremony called the Making of the Mani Pills:”—</p>

<p>“Certain indestructible particles of the bodies of the Buddhas and
saints, as well as certain other bodily remains, have ever been considered
by Buddhists to enjoy certain properties, such as that of emitting
light, and of having great curative properties. The travels of Huein-Tsang
and of Fa-hsien are filled with accounts of the discovery of
such treasures, and of the supernatural properties which they possessed.
Among Thibetans, the first class of these relics is known
as ‘pedung’ (upel-gedung), the second as ‘dung-rus’ (gdung-rus).
They say the pedung are minute globules found in the bones of
Buddhas and saints, that they possess wonderful brilliancy, and that
sometimes they may be seen on the exterior of some saintly person,
when they have the appearance of brilliant drops of sweat. While
these pedung have most potent curative properties, they become also
the palladium of the locality fortunate enough to have them. By a
natural extension of the idea of the power of pedung, Thibetans have
come to think that if one preserves and carries about on one’s person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
even a little of the excretions, or of the hair or nail-trimmings of a
saint who is known to have pedung, such, for instance, as the Tale-Lama,
or the Panchan-Rimpoche, they will shield him from gun or
sword wounds, sickness, etc.; hence the extraordinary objects one so
often finds in Thibetan charm-boxes (Ka-Wo).</p>

<p>“The properties of pedung have also given rise to another belief,
with which this paper is more properly concerned,—that of manufacturing
pills, to which the god Shourizog, at the supplication of the
officiating lamas, imparts the properties of his own divine body, and
then imparts to them the curative and protective properties of real
pedung. These pills are known as mani-rilbu, or ‘precious pills,’
and are in constant use as medicine among the people of Thibet and
Mongolia. Large quantities of them are also sent by each tribute-bearing
minion to the Emperor of China. In Chinese, they are called
‘Tsu-mu-yas,’ or ‘thih-ma-yao,’ and must not be confounded with a
liliaceous plant of same name (Hanbury’s <i>Anemarhena asphodeloides</i>),
the rhizome of which is used in medicine, and which is also a product
of Thibet.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the better name for ‘mani-rilbu’ is ‘tzu-sheng-wan,’
‘dilated pills,’ which I have heard used for them in Pekin, as will be
better seen after reading the following account of the manner in
which they are manufactured.</p>

<p>“The greater part of the account here given of the process of
making the pills is taken from a Thibetan work containing a minute
account of the ceremony, together with the prayers to be recited, etc.,
the title of which is ‘Ceremony of Making Mani Pills’ (Mani Rilbu
grub gi choga), in seven leaves.</p>

<p>“Verbal explanations from the lamas who explained the text to me
are incorporated wherever necessary.</p>

<p>“Seven days prior to the commencement of the ceremony the lama
who is to conduct it and the priests who are to take part in it commence
to abstain from the use of meat, spirits, garlic, tobacco, and
other articles of food held impure, or which are bad-smelling, and
during the progress of the ceremony, which is twenty-one, forty-nine,
or one hundred days in length, none of the above articles are allowed
in the temple, nor are unclean persons or those who are partaking of
the above prohibited substances.</p>

<p>“The ceremony begins by making the pills, and the process is described,
in the work mentioned above, as follows: “The Lama, his
head clean-shaved, and his vestments being as they should be, grinds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
into fine flour some roasted grain, then mixing it with pure and sweet-scented
water, he makes the necessary amount of paste; the pills are
then made and coated over with red. When all this has been done, a
vase is taken which is dry and without any flaw or blemish, and which
is also perfectly clean, and in it the pills are poured until it is two-thirds
full. The vase is then wrapped in a silk cover, which is tied on
with a silk thread, and sealed. The vase, after this, is put on a
stand, in a perfectly upright position, and around the latter are
arranged bowls of water and other offerings, two by two. The most
revered image of Tug-je-chon-po (i. e., Shouresig) which the lamasery
possesses is then clothed in its robes, and placed on top of the vase;
then, without shaking the vase, a dorje (a marginal note explains that
this is the Thunder-bolt or Sadjra of Indra: it is in constant use in
all the Lamaist ceremonies, and is generally held in the right hand,
between the thumb and index, while prayers are being read. In the
left hand the lama usually holds a bell), wrapped in a clean piece of
cotton or woollen stuff, is tied to the string around the neck of the
vase. After an interval of meditation and prayer, offerings are made of
‘water, flowers, incense, lamps, perfumes, food, etc., ... while music
plays.’ Then the help of the god is invoked ‘to impart the necessary
virtues to the pills, ... for this world is sunk in sin and iniquity,
and Shouresig alone can help it, and drag it out of the mire.’ As a
means thereto he is now besought, in his great mercifulness, to bless
these pills, so that they may free from the orb of transmigration those
who shall have attained maturity of mind, to impart to them by
absorption the peculiar flavor of his resplendent person, so that they
may become indistinguishable from it, like water poured into water,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>“This ceremony, which is a most expensive one, and most trying
on the Lamas, is not at all common in the Lamaseries of China or
Mongolia, and is confined to the larger one in Thibet; the only one
at Pekin, where it is sometimes performed, is the Shih-fang-tang, to
the west of the Hsi-huang-tsu, outside of the north side of the city.”</p>

<p>The above ceremony describes a symbolical alvine dejection, and the
most plausible explanation is, that the lamas, finding trade good and
the Buddhist laity willing to accept more “amulets” than the Grand
Lama was able, unaided, to supply, hit upon this truly miraculous
mode of replenishing their stock.</p>

<p>Mr. Rockhill explains that the word “pedung,” used in the above
description, means “remains.” Taking into consideration the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
that these people, although remotely, are related to the Aryan stock,
which is the ancestor of the English, German, Irish, Latin, and others,
from which we spring, the meaning, as here given, is certainly not
without significance. “Dung,” in our own tongue, means nothing
more nor less than remains, reliquiæ of a certain kind.</p>

<p>Webster traces the word “dung” to the Anglo-Saxon dung, dyncg,
dincg,—excrement; Dyngan, to dung; N. H. German, dung, dunger;
O. H. German, Tunga; Sw. Dynga; Danish, Dynge and Dyngd; Icelandic,
Dyngia and Dy. This shows it to be essentially Indo-Germanic
in type, and fairly to be compared with the words “pedung” and
“dung-rus” of Mr. Rockhill’s manuscript.</p>

<p>In the country of Ur of the Chaldees, which was the home of Abraham
(Gen. xi. 2), there reigned a king, “the father of Dungi.” The
exact meaning of the name “Dungi” has not been made known. The
name of the king himself, strangely enough, was “Urea,” or “Uri,”—it
is read both ways. His date has been fixed at 3,000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The information in preceding paragraph was furnished by Prof. Otis
T. Mason, of the National Museum, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Lenormant makes him out as of high antiquity,—“the most ancient
of the Babylonian kings,” “kings who can vie in antiquity with
the builders of the Egyptian pyramids,—Dungi, for instance.”—(“Chaldean
Magic,” p. 333.)</p>

<p>Smith ascribes him to the date of at least 2,000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>—(“Assyrian
Discoveries,” New York, 1876, p. 232.)</p>

<p>Mr. W. W. Rockhill, for six years secretary of the Legation of the
United States, in Pekin, is a member of the Oriental Society, and a
scholar of the highest attainments, more particularly in all that relates
to the languages, customs, and religions of China and Thibet, in
which countries he has travelled extensively.</p>

<p>The sacred pills presented by him to the author were enclosed in a
silver reliquary, elaborately chased and ornamented; in size they were
about as large as quail-shot; their color was almost orange, or between
that and an ochreous red.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Surgeon-General John Moore, U. S. Army,
they were analyzed by Dr. Mew, U. S. Army, with the following
results:—</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STERCORANISTES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>That Christian polemics have not been entirely free from such
ideas may be shown satisfactorily to any one having the leisure to
examine the various phases of the discussion upon the doctrine of the
Eucharist.</p>

<p>The word “stercoranistes,” or “stercorarians,” is not to be found
in the last edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica; but in the edition
of 1841 the definition of the word is as follows: “Stercorarians, or
Stercoranistes, formed from <i>stercus</i>, ‘dung,’ a name which those of the
Romish church originally gave to such as held that the host was liable
to digestion and all its consequences, like other food.” This definition
was copied verbatim in Rees’s Cyclopædia of Arts, Sciences, and Literature,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The dispute upon “Stercoranisme” began in 831, upon the appearance
of a theological treatise by a monk named Paschasius Radbert.—(See
the “Institutes of Ecclesiastical History,” John Lawrence von
Mosheim, translated by John Murdock, D.D., New Haven, 1832, vol. ii.
p. 104 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The grossly sensual conception of the presence of the Lord’s body
in the sacrament, according to which that body is eaten, digested, and
evacuated like ordinary food, is of ancient standing, though not found
in Origen, nor perhaps in Rhabanus Maurus. It certainly originated
with a class of false teachers contemporary with or earlier than Rhabanus
Maurus, whom Paschasius Radbert condemns,—“Frivolum est
ergo in hoc mysterio cogitare in stercore ne commisceatur in digestione
alterius cibi” (De Corp. et Sanguin. Domin. cap. 20). He does not,
however, apply the term “Stercoranistes” to his opponents. Cardinal
Humbert is the first to so employ the word. This use was in a polemic
against Nicetas Pectoratus, written in support of Azymitism, etc.
From this source the word was adopted into common usage.—(Schrockli
Kirchengesch. XXIII.? 429, 499; Herzog, Real Encyclop., s. v.; McClintock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and Strong, Cyclop. of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical
Literature, New York, 1880; see also Schaff-Herzog, “Cyclopædia of
Religious Knowledge,” New York, 1881, article “Stercoranistes.”)</p>

<p>(Stercoranistes.) (Hist. Eccles.) “Nom que quelques écrivains ont
donné a ceux qui pensoient que les symboles eucharistiques êtoient
sujets à la digestion et à toutes ses suites de même que les autres nourritures
corporelles.... Ce mot est dérivé du Latin, ‘stercus,’ excrement.
On ne convient pas généralement de l’existence de cette erreur.
Le président Manguin l’attribue à Amalaire, auteur du neuvième siècle....
Et le cardinal Humbert dans sa réponse a Nicetas Pectoratus,
l’appelle nettement stercoraniste, parceque celui-ci prétendoit que la
perception de l’hostie rompoit le jeûne. Enfin, Alger attribue la même
erreur aux Grecs. Mais ces accusations ne paroissent pas fondées, car;
... Amalaire propose à la vérité la question si les espèces eucharistiques
se consument comme les aliments ordinaires; mais, il ne la décide
pas. Nicetas prétend aussi que l’Eucharistique rompt le jeûne,
soit qu’il reste dans les espèces quelque vertu nutritive, soit parce
qu’après avoir récu l’Eucharistique, ou peut prendre autres aliments;
mais, il ne paroit pas avoir admis la consequence que lui impute le
Cardinal Humbert. Il ne paroit pas non plus que les autres Grecs
soient tombés dans cette erreur. S. Jean Damascene les en disculpe.
Mais, soit que le Stercoranisme ait existé ou non, les protestans n’en
peuvent tirer aucun avantage contre la présence réele, que cette erreur
suppose plutôt qu’elle ne l’ébranle.”—(Voyez M. Wuitass, traité de
l’Eucharistie, première partie, quest. 2, art. 1; p. 416 et suiv. Encyclop.
ou Diction. Raisson. des Sciences, des Arts, et des Metiers, tome
quinzième, Neufchatel, 1765, art. “Stercoranistes.”)</p>

<p>“Si qui fuerunt, fuere nonnulli nono sæculo, qui Corpus Christi
quod in Eucharistia continetur secessui, ac defectioni obnoxium esse
putabat ita ut corruptis speciebus et ipsum Corpus Christi corrumperatur.”—(“Dict.
of Sects and Heresies,” etc., T. H. Blunt, Oxford,
1874, where a number of references are given.)</p>

<p>“Stercorantistarum, nomen non sectæ, sed convitii fuit.”—(Baronius,
“Annales,” Lucca, 1758.)</p>

<p>Stercoranisme. Stercoranistes. Stercus. “Membre d’une secte
qui souténait que les espèces de l’Eucharistie étaient digérées et transformées
en excrément comme les autres aliments” (Encyclop.).</p>

<p>“On a désigné dans le XIX. siècle sous le nom de Stercoranistes, les
théologiens qui niaient que la substance du pain et du vin fut changée
dans l’Eucharistie au corps et au sang de Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Tout ce qui entre dans la bouche, descend le ventre et va au
rétrait.”</p>

<p>“Prétendirent que si le corps et le sang de Jésus Christ, avaient
pris la place de la substance du pain et du vin, ils devraient subir les
mêmes accidents qui seraient arrivés à cette substance si elle avait été
reçue par le communiant.”—(P. Larousse, “Grand Dictionnaire Universel,”
Paris, 1875.)</p>

<p>Brand, in his “Encyclopædia of Science, Literature, and Art,” article
“Stercoranism,” says: “A nickname which seems to have been applied
in the Western churches in the fifth and sixth centuries to those
who held the opinion that a change took place in the consecrated elements,
so as to render the divine body subject to the act of digestion.”
He refers to Mosheim’s “Ecclesiastical History” for a fuller
account.</p>

<p>The same ideas obtained among the illiterate as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The First Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus Christ seems to have been
received by the Gnostics of the second century as canonical, and accepted
in the same sense by Eusebius, Athanasius, Chrysostom, and
others of the Fathers and writers of the Church. Sozomen was told
by travellers in Egypt that they had heard in that country of the
miracles performed by the water in which the infant Jesus had been
washed. According to Ahmed ben Idris, this gospel was used in parts
of the East in common with the other gospels; while Ocobius de Castro
asserts that in many churches of Asia and Africa it was recited exclusively.
(See Introduction to the “Apocryphal New Testament,”
William Hone, London, 1820.) But, on the other hand, all the apocrypha
were condemned by Pope Gelasius in the fifth century; and
this interdict was not repealed until the time of Paul IV. in the sixteenth
century.—(See Bunsen, “Analecta,” Hamburg, 1703.)</p>

<p>In the following extracts it will be noted that the miracles recorded
were wrought either by the swaddling-clothes themselves or by the
water in which they had been cleansed; and the inference is
that the excreta of Christ were believed, as in many other instances,
to have the character of a panacea, as well as generally miraculous
properties.</p>

<p>The Madonna gave one of the swaddling clothes of Christ to the
Wise Men of the East who visited him; they took it home, “and having,
according to the custom of their country, made a fire, they worshipped
it.... And casting the swaddling cloth into the fire, the fire
took it and kept it” (1 Inf. iii. 6, 7).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>We read of the Finnish deity Wainemoinen that “the sweat which
dropped from his body was a balm for all diseases.” The very same
virtues were possessed by the sweat of the Egyptian god Ra (“Chaldean
Magic,” Lenormant, p. 247, quoting the Kalewala, part 2,
r. 14).</p>

<p>On arrival in Egypt after the Flight—“When the Lady Saint Mary
had washed the swaddling clothes of the Lord Christ and hanged them
out to dry upon a post ... a certain boy ... possessed with the
devil, took down one of them and put it upon his head. And presently
the devils began to come out of his mouth and fly away in the
shape of crows and serpents. And from this time the boy was healed
by the power of the Lord Christ.”—(1 Inf. iv. 15, 16, 17.)</p>

<p>“On the return journey from Egypt, Christ had healed by a kiss a
lady whom cursed Satan ... had leaped upon ... in the form of a
serpent. On the morrow, the same woman brought perfumed water
to wash the Lord Jesus; when she had washed him, she preserved the
water. And there was a girl whose body was white with leprosy, who
being sprinkled with this water was instantly cleansed from her leprosy.”—(1
Inf. vi. 16, 17).</p>

<p>There is another example of exactly the same kind in 1 Inf. vi. 34.
See, again, 1 Inf. ix. 1, 4, 5, 9; x. 2, 3; xii. 4, 5, 6. “And in Matarea
the Lord Jesus caused a well to spring forth, in which Saint Mary
washed his coat. And a balsam is produced or grown in that country
from the sweat which ran down there from the Lord Jesus.”—(Gospel
of the Infancy, viii.: “The Apocryphal New Testament,” William
Hone, London, 1820, p. 47.)</p>

<p>“In Ireland, weakly children are taken to drink the ablution, that
is, the water and wine with which the chalice is rinsed after the priest
has taken the communion,—the efficacy arising from the cup having
just before contained the body of our Lord.” (See “Folk-Medicine,”
Black, London, 1883, p. 88.) The same cure was also in vogue in England,
and in each case for the whooping-cough.</p>

<p>This has all the appearance of a commingling of two separate streams
of thought; compare with it the notes on the expression from Juvenal,
“Priapo ille bibit vitreo,” page 428, as well as those in regard to
the canons of Beauvais on page 429.</p>

<p>“An offshoot of the Khlysti, known as the “Shakouni,” or Jumpers,
openly professed debauchery and libertinism to excess.... Others of
their rites are abject and disgusting; their chief is the living Christ,
and their communion consists in embracing his body,—ordinary disciples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
may kiss his hand or his foot; to those of a more fervent piety,
he offers his tongue.”—(“The Russian Church and Russian Dissent,”
Albert F. Heard, New York and London, 1887, pp. 261-262.)</p>

<h3>UN DALAI-LAMA IRLANDAIS.</h3>

<p>“A l’occasion des reliques journalières du Dalai-Lama dont on fait
des pilules pour les dévots, histoire que les imprimeurs de cette Revue
n’avaient pas voulu ‘avaler’ (voir plus haut, col. 24) Mr. Wh. Stokes
nous a signalé un curieux passage des annales irlandaises. Nous croyons
intéressant de le traduire ici. Cet ‘acte de foi’ se passait en l’an
605, et le héros en est le roi Aedh, surnommé Uairidhnach.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“Un jour il passa, n’étant encore que prince royal, par le territoire
d’Othain-Muira; il lava ses mains à la rivière qui traversa le territoire
de la ville. Othain est le nom de la rivière, et c’est de là que la
ville a son nom. Il prit de l’eau pour s’en laver la figure. Un de ses
gens l’arrêta. ‘Roi, dit-il, ne mets pas cette eau sur ton visage.’
‘Quoi donc?’ dit le roi. ‘J’ai honte de le dire,’ dit-il. ‘Quelle honte
as-tu à dire la vérité? dit le roi. ‘Voici ce que c’est,’ dit-il; ‘c’est
sur cette eau que se trouve le <i>water-closet</i> des clercs.’ ‘Est-ce ici,
que vient le clerc lui-même’ (c’est à dire le chef des clercs) ‘pour se
soulager?’</p>

<p>“‘C’est ici même,’ dit le page. ‘Non seulement,’ dit le roi, ‘je mettrai
cette eau sur ma figure, mais j’en mettrai dans ma bouche, et j’en
boirai’ (et il en but trois gorgées); ‘car l’eau où il se soulage vaut pour
moi l’eucharistie.’</p>

<p>“Cela fut raconté à Muira (le chef des clercs), et il rendit grâces à
Dieu de ce que Aedh avait une semblable foi; et il appela auprès de
lui Aedh et il lui dit: ‘Cher fils, en récompense de ce respect que tu
as montré à l’Église, je te promets, en présence de Dieu, que tu obtiendras
bientôt la royauté d’Irlande, que tu auras victoire et triomphe
sur tes ennemis, que tu ne mourras pas de mort subite,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> que tu
recevras le corps de Christ de ma main, et je prierai le Seigneur pour
toi, pour que ce soit la vieillesse qui t’enlève de cette vie.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Ce fut peu de temps après cela qu’Aedh obtint la royauté d’Irlande
et il donna des terres fertiles à Muira d’Othain.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>“Comme le lecteur ne manquera pas de le remarquer, c’est par édification
que l’annaliste, clerc lui-même, raconte cette histoire. En effet,
elle fait honneur à la piété du roi et elle prouve que ‘le respect montré à
l’Église ... a obtenu sa récompense.’ Ce qui vient des hommes de
Dieu participe en effet au caractère sacré de Dieu qu’ils représentent.</p>

<p>“Si l’on cherchait à étendre cette enquête de scatologie hiératique on
trouverait sans doute bien des croyances et des pratiques répugnantes
à notre goût de civilisés, mais raisonnables en un sens quand on accepte
le point de départ, quand on ne condamne pas la logique, et surtout
quand on se rappelle que le dégoût pour les résidus de la digestion
n’est devenu instinctif que pour la vie civilisée et les habitudes sociales.
Les peuples qui ne se lavent pas doivent certainement sentir autrement
que nous, et même ne pas sentir du tout; et nos ancêtres de l’âge des
cavernes n’avaient certainement l’odorat plus difficile. On assure que
chez les Namas, tribu hottentote, le shaman qui célèbre un mariage
asperge les conjoints de son urine. Cela remplace notre eau bénite.
Le shaman est en effet ’un homme de Dieu,’ par excellence; car,
lorsqu’il se livre à ces danses désordonnées qui sont une partie du
culte, on croit que le dieu descend en lui, non en esprit, mais en réalité.</p>

<p>“C’est aussi le cas de rappeler un usage linguistique des habitants de
Samoa dans la Polynésie. Lorsqu’une femme est sur le point d’accoucher,
on adresse des prières au dieu ou génie de la famille du père et
à celui de la famille de la mère. Quand l’enfant est né, la mère demande
quel dieu on était en train de prier à ce moment. On en prend
soigneusement note et ce dieu sera en quelque sorte le “patron” de
l’enfant pendant le reste de sa vie.</p>

<p>“Par respect pour ce dieu, l’enfant est appelé son excrément et pendant
son enfance on l’appelle réellement, comme ‘petit-nom,’ ‘m⸺
de Tongo,’ ou de Satia, ou de tout autre dieu, suivant le cas. La
formule est grossière, mais l’intention, sous une apparence tout matérielle,
part d’un sentiment de respect et de piété à l’égard de la
divinité.”</p>

<p>The last two paragraphs of the above are taken from the work of
the missionary Turner, who lived for seventeen years in the islands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Polynesia; they appear in his “Samoa,” London, 1884, p. 79. But in
the same book, issued under the title “Polynesia,” London, 1861, it
has been expunged.</p>

<p>The mother of the King of Uganda invited Speke to visit her and
drink pombé, the native plantain wine; when she happened to spill
some of this the servants “instantly fought over it, dabbing their
noses on the ground, or grabbing it with their hands, that not one
atom of the queen’s favor might be lost; for everything must be
adored that comes from royalty, whether by design or accident.”
(Speke, “Nile,” London, 1863, vol. ii. p. 313.) This is the Grand
Lama business over again and nothing else.</p>

<p>The people of Madagascar have an annual feast of the greatest solemnity,
during which no cattle are allowed to be slaughtered; “which
means that none can be eaten, as meat will not keep twenty-four hours
in Madagascar.” This festival is called “The Queen’s Bath,” and is
arranged with much parade. “When the water was warm the queen
stepped down and entered the curtained space. In a few moments
salvos of artillery announced to the people that the queen was taking
her bath. In a few minutes more she reappeared, sumptuously clothed
with jewels. She carried a horn filled with the bath-water, with which
she sprinkled the company.”—(“Evening Star,” Washington, D. C.,
quoting from “Transcript,” Boston, Massachusetts.)</p>

<p>That the ruler of a tribe or nation is in some manner connected with
and representative of the deities adored by the tribe or nation, is a form
of man-worship presenting its most perfect manifestation in the reverence
accorded the Grand Lama; but no part of the world has been free
from it, and among our own forefathers it obstinately held its ground
in the opinion so long prevalent all over Europe that the touch of the
king’s hand would cure the scrofula. This remedial potency was also
ascribed to women in a certain condition.</p>

<p>“Scrofulous sores were believed by some to be cured by the touch
of a menstruating woman.”—(Pliny, Bohn’s edition, lib. 28, cap.
24.)</p>

<p>“The Hindu wife is in Paradise compared to the Hindu widow. The
condition of the wife is bad enough. As the slave of her husband, she
eats after he is through, and she eats what is left. She has no education
to speak of, and her only hope of salvation is in him. She stands
while he sits in the household; and she cannot, if she lives in the interior,
go to the Ganges and bathe herself in the sacred water. I am
told that in many cases she considers it a privilege to bathe her husband’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
feet after he returns, and thinks that she gets some absolution
from sin by drinking the water.”—(Frank G. Carpenter, in “World,”
New York, June 30, 1889.)</p>

<p>“Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, possessed the power of curing individuals
attacked by enlarged spleen by simply pressing his right foot upon that
viscera.”—(“The Physicians of the Middle Ages,” T. C. Minor, M.D.,
Cincinnati, Ohio, 1889, p. 5. A translation of “Le Moyen Age Médical,”
of Dr. Edmond Dupouy.)</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BACCHIC ORGIES OF THE GREEKS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Bacchic orgies of the Greeks, while not strictly assimilated to
the ur-orgies, can scarcely be overlooked in this connection.</p>

<p>Montfaucon describes the Omophagi of the Greeks: “Les Omophagies
étoient une fête des Grecs qui passoient la fureur Bacchique;
ils s’entortilloient, dit Arnobe, de serpens et mangeoient des entrailles
de Cabri crues, dont ils avaient la bouche toute ensanglantée; cela
est exprimée par le nom Omophage. Nous avons vu quelquefois des
hommes tous entortillez de serpens et particulièrement dans Mithras.”—(Montfaucon,
“L’Antiquité expliquée,” tome 2, book 4, p. 22.)</p>

<p>The references to serpent-worship are curious, in view of the fact
that such ophic rites still are celebrated among the Mokis, the next-door
neighbors of the Zuñis, and once existed among the Zuñis themselves.
The allusion to <i>Mithras</i> would seem to imply that these orgies
must have been known to the Persians as well as the Greeks.</p>

<p>Bryant, speaking of the Greek orgies, uses this language: “Both in
the orgies of Bacchus and in the rites of Ceres, as well as of other
deities, one part of the mysteries consisted in a ceremony (<i>omophagia</i>),
at which time they ate the flesh quite crude with the blood. In Crete,
at the Dionisiaca, they used to tear the flesh with their teeth from the
animal when alive.”—(Bryant, “Mythology,” London, 1775, vol. ii.
p. 12.)</p>

<p>And again, on p. 13: “The Mænules and Bacchæ used to devour
the raw limbs of animals which they had cut or torn asunder....
In the island of Chios it was a religious custom to tear a man limb
from limb, by way of sacrifice to Dionysius. From all which we may
learn one sad truth, that there is scarce anything so impious and unnatural
as not, at times, to have prevailed.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Faber tells us that: “The Cretans had an annual festival ...
in their frenzy they tore a living bull with their teeth, and brandished
serpents in their hands.”—(Faber, “Pagan Idolatry,” London,
1816, vol ii. p. 265.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h3>BACCHIC ORGIES IN NORTH AMERICA.</h3>

<p>These orgies were duplicated among many of the tribes of North
America. Paul Kane describes the inauguration of Clea-clach, a
Clallum chief (northwest coast of British America): “He seized a
small dog and began devouring it alive.” He also bit pieces from the
shoulders of the male by-standers.—(See “Artist’s Wanderings in
North America,” London, 1859, p. 212; also, the same thing quoted by
Herbert Spencer in “Descriptive Sociology.”)</p>

<p>Speaking of these ceremonies, Dr. Franz Boas says: “Members of
tribes practising the Hamatsa ceremonies show remarkable scars produced
by biting. At certain festivals it is the duty of the Hamatsa to
bite a piece of flesh out of the arms, leg, or breast of a man.” (“Report
on the North-Western Indians of Canada,” in “Proceedings of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,” Newcastle-upon-Tyne
Meeting, 1889, p. 12.) Doctor Boas demonstrates that the actions of
the Hamatsa are an example of Ritualistic Cannibalism. (See idem,
p. 55.) And, speaking of the secret societies observed among the
Indians of the British northwest coast, he remarks that each has its
own ceremonies. “The Nutlematl must be as filthy as possible.”—(Idem,
p. 54.)</p>

<p>“Bernardin de Saint Pierre, in his ‘Études de la Nature’ gives it as
his opinion that to eat dog’s-flesh is the first step towards cannibalism,
and certainly, when I enumerate to myself the peoples whom I visited
who actually, more or less, devoured human flesh, and find that among
them dogs were invariably considered a delicacy, I cannot but believe
that there is some truth in the hypothesis.” (Schweinfurth, “Heart
of Africa,” London, 1872, vol. i. p. 191.) The Clallums, no doubt, in
their frenzies, tore dogs to pieces as a substitute for the human victim
of an earlier period in their culture.</p>

<p>Bancroft describes like orgies among the Chimsyans, of British North
America. (See in “Native Races of the Pacific Slope,” vol. i. p. 171.)
While the Nootkas medicine men are said to have an orgy in which
“live dogs and dead human bodies are seized and torn by their teeth;
but, at least in later times, they seem not to attack the living, and
their performances are somewhat less horrible and bloody than the
wild orgies of the Northern tribes.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 202.)</p>

<p>The Haidahs, of the same coast, indulge in an orgy in which the
performer “snatches up the first dog he can find, kills him, and tearing
pieces of his flesh, eats them.”—(Dall, quoting Dawson, in “Masks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and Labrets,” Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington,
D. C., 1886.)</p>

<p>In describing the six secret soldier societies or bands of the Mandans,
Maximilian, of Wied, calls attention to the three leaders of one band,
who were called dogs, who are “obliged, if any one throws a piece of
meat into the ashes or on the ground, saying, ‘There, dog, eat,’ to fall
upon it and devour it raw, like dogs or beasts of prey.”—(Maximilian,
Prince of Wied, “Travels,” &amp;c., London, 1843, pp. 356, 446.)</p>

<p>A further multiplication of references is unnecessary. The above
would appear to be enough to establish the existence of almost identical
orgies in Europe, America, and Asia—orgies in which were perpetuated
the ritualistic use of foods no longer employed by the populace,
and possibly commemorating a former condition of cannibalism.</p>

<h3>THE SACRIFICE OF THE DOG A SUBSTITUTION FOR HUMAN SACRIFICE.</h3>

<p>It would add much to the bulk of this chapter to show that the dog
has almost invariably been employed as a substitute for man in sacrifice.
Other animals have performed the same vicarious office, but none
to the same extent, especially among the more savage races. To the
American Indians and other peoples of a corresponding stage of development,
the substitution presents no logical incongruity. Their religious
conceptions are so strongly tinged with <i>zoolatry</i> that the assignment
of animals to the <i>rôle</i> of deities or of victims is the most natural
thing in the world; but their belief is not limited to the idea that the
animal is sacred; it comprehends, additionally, a settled appreciation of
the fact that <i>lycanthropy</i> is possible, and that the medicine-men possess
the power of transforming men into animals or animals into men.
Such a belief was expressed to the writer in the most forcible way, in
the village of Zuñi, in 1881. The Indians were engaged in some one
of their countless dances and ceremonies (and possibly not very far
from the time of the urine dance), when the dancers seized a small
dog and tore it limb from limb, venting upon it every torture that
savage spite and malignity could devise. The explanation given was
that the hapless cur was a “Navajo,” a tribe to which the Zuñis
have been spasmodically hostile for generations, and from whose ranks
the fortunes of war must have enabled them to drag an occasional captive
to be put to the torture and sacrificed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastman describes the “Dog Dance” of the Sioux, in which
the dogs represented Chippewas, and had their hearts eaten raw by
the Sioux.</p>

<span class="smaller">POISONOUS MUSHROOMS USED IN UR-ORGIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Indians in and around Cape Flattery, on the Pacific coast of
British North America, retain the urine dance in an unusually
repulsive form. As was learned from Mr. Kennard, U.S. Coast Survey,
whom the writer had the pleasure of meeting in Washington, D.C.,
in 1886, the medicine men distil, from potatoes and other ingredients,
a vile liquor, which has an irritating and exciting effect upon the
kidneys and bladder. Each one who has partaken of this dish immediately
urinates and passes the result to his next neighbor, who drinks.
The effect is as above, and likewise a temporary insanity or delirium,
during which all sorts of mad capers are carried on. The last man who
quaffs the poison, distilled through the persons of five or six comrades,
is so completely overcome that he falls in a dead stupor.</p>

<p>Precisely the same use of a poisonous fungus has been described
among the natives of the Pacific coast of Siberia, according to the
learned Dr. J. W. Kingsley (of Brome Hall, Scole, England). Such a
rite is outlined by Schultze. “The Shamans of Siberia drink a decoction
of toad-stools or the urine of those who have become narcotized by
that plant.”—(Schultze, “Fetichism,” New York, 1885, p. 52.)</p>

<p>The Ur-Orgy of the natives of Siberia should be found fully described
by explorers in the employ of the Russian Government. Application
was accordingly made by the author to the Hon. Lambert Tree,
the American Minister at the Court of St. Petersburgh, who evinced a
warm interest in the work of unearthing from the Imperial archives
all that bore upon the use of the mushroom as a urino-intoxicant.
Unfortunately, the official term of Mr. Tree having expired, no information
was obtained from him in time for incorporation in these
pages.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is due in this connection to Mr. Wurtz, the American
Chargé d’Affaires at St. Petersburgh, as well as to his Excellency
the Russian Minister of Public Instruction, for courteous interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
manifested in the investigations made necessary by the amplification
of the original pamphlet.</p>

<p>Conferences were also had with his Excellency the Chinese Minister
and with Dr. H. T. Allen, Secretary of the Corean Legation, in Washington,
but beyond developing the fact that in the minor medicine of
those countries resort was still had to excrementitious curatives, the
information deduced was meagre and unimportant.</p>

<p>Dependence was therefore necessarily placed upon the accounts of
American or English explorers of undisputed authority.</p>

<p>George Kennan describes a wedding which he saw in one of the villages
of Kamtchatka: “After the conclusion of the ceremony we removed
to an adjacent tent, and were surprised as we came out into the
open air to see three or four Koraks shouting and reeling in an advanced
stage of intoxication,—celebrating, I suppose, the happy wedding
which had just transpired. I knew that there was not a drop of
alcoholic liquor in all Northern Kamtchatka, nor, so far as I knew,
anything from which it could be made, and it was a mystery to me
how they had succeeded in becoming so suddenly, thoroughly, hopelessly,
undeniably drunk. Even Ross Browne’s beloved Washoe, with
its ‘howling wilderness’ saloons, could not have turned out more
creditable specimens of intoxicated humanity than those before us.</p>

<p>“The exciting agent, whatever it might be, was certainly as quick
in its operation and as effective in its results as any ‘tanglefoot’ or
‘bottled lightning’ known to modern civilization.</p>

<p>“Upon inquiry, we learned to our astonishment that they had been
eating a species of the plant vulgarly known as ‘toadstool.’ There is
a peculiar fungus of this class in Siberia, known to the natives as ‘muk-a-moor,’
and as it possesses active intoxicating properties, it is used as
a stimulant by nearly all the Siberian tribes.</p>

<p>“Taken in large doses, it is a violent narcotic poison, but in small
doses it produces all the effects of alcoholic liquor.</p>

<p>“Its habitual use, however, completely shatters the nervous system,
and its sale by Russian traders to the natives has consequently been
made a penal offence by the Russian law. In spite of all prohibitions
the trade is still secretly carried on, and I have seen twenty dollars’
worth of furs bought with a single fungus.</p>

<p>“The Koraks would gather it for themselves, but it requires the
shelter of timber for its growth, and is not to be found on the barren
steppes over which they wander; so that they are obliged for the most
part to buy it at enormous prices from the Russian traders. It may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
sound strangely to American ears, but the invitation which a convivial
Korak extends to his passing friend is not ‘Come in and have a drink,’
but ‘Won’t you come in and take a toadstool?’—not a very alluring
proposal perhaps to a civilized toper, but one which has a magical
effect upon a dissipated Korak. As the supply of these toadstools is
by no means equal to the demand, Korak ingenuity has been greatly
exercised in the endeavor to economize the precious stimulant and
make it go as far as possible.</p>

<p>“Sometimes in the course of human events it becomes imperatively
necessary that a whole band should get drunk together, and they have
only one toadstool to do it with. For a description of the manner in
which this band gets drunk collectively and individually upon one
fungus, and keeps drunk for a week, the curious reader is referred to
Goldsmith’s ‘A Citizen of the World,’ Letter 32.</p>

<p>“It is but just to say, however, that this horrible practice is almost
entirely confined to the settled Koraks of Penzshink Gulf,—the
lowest, most degraded portion of the whole tribe. It may prevail to
a limited extent among the wandering natives, but I never heard of
more than one such instance outside the Penzshink Gulf settlements.”—(“Tent
Life in Siberia,” George Kennan, New York and London,
1887, pp. 202-204.)</p>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith speaks of “a curious custom” among “the Tartars
of Koraki.... The Russians who trade with them carry thither a
kind of mushroom.... These mushrooms the rich Tartars lay up in
large quantities for the winter; and when a nobleman makes a mushroom
feast all the neighbors around are invited. The mushrooms are
prepared by boiling, by which the water acquires an intoxicating quality,
and is a sort of drink which the Tartars prize beyond all other.
When the nobility and ladies are assembled, and the ceremonies
usual between people of distinction over, the mushroom broth goes
freely round, and they laugh, talk <i>double-entendres</i>, grow fuddled, and
become excellent company. The poorer sort, who love mushroom
broth to distraction as well as the rich, but cannot afford it at first
hand, post themselves on these occasions round the huts of the rich,
and watch the opportunity of the ladies and gentlemen as they come
down to pass their liquor, and holding a wooden bowl, catch the delicious
fluid, very little altered by filtration, being still strongly tinctured
with the intoxicating quality. Of this they drink with the
utmost satisfaction, and thus they get as drunk and as jovial as their
betters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“‘Happy nobility!’ cried my companion, ‘who can fear no diminution
of respect unless seized with strangury, and who when drunk are
most useful! Though we have not this custom among us, I foresee
that if it were introduced, we might have many a toad-eater in England
ready to drink from the wooden bowl on these occasions, and to
praise the flavor of his lordship’s liquor. As we have different classes
of gentry, who knows but we may see a lord holding the bowl to the minister,
a knight holding it to his lordship, and a simple squire drinking
it double-distilled from the loins of knighthood?’”—(Oliver Goldsmith,
“Letters from a Citizen of the World,” No. 32. This is based
upon Philip Van Stralenburgh’s “Histori-Geographical Description of
the North and Eastern Part of Europe and Asia,” London, 1736,
p. 397.)</p>

<p>“The <i>Amanita muscaria</i> possesses an intoxicating property, and is
employed by Northern nations as an inebriant. The following is the
account of Langsdorf, as given by Greville:—</p>

<p>“This variety of <i>Amanita muscaria</i> is used by the inhabitants of
the northeastern parts of Asia in the same manner as wine, brandy,
arrack, opium, etc., is by other nations. Such fungi are found most
plentifully about Wischna, Kamtchatka, and Willowa Derecona, and
are very abundant in some seasons, and scarce in others. They are
collected in the hottest months, and hung up by a string to dry in the
air; some dry themselves on the ground, and are said to be far more
narcotic than those artificially preserved. Small, deep-colored specimens,
deeply covered with warts, are also said to be more powerful
than those of a larger size and paler color.</p>

<p>“The usual mode of taking the fungus is to roll it up like a bolus
and swallow it without chewing, which the Kamtchkadales say would
disorder the stomach.</p>

<p>“It is sometimes eaten fresh in soups and sauces, and then loses
much of its intoxicating property. When steeped in the juice of the
berries of the <i>Vaccinum uliginosum</i>, its effects are those of a strong wine.
One large and two small fungi are a common dose to produce a pleasant
intoxication for a whole day, particularly if water be drunk after it,
which augments the narcotic principle.</p>

<p>“The desired effect comes in from one to two hours after taking the
fungus. Giddiness and drunkenness result in the same manner as
from wine or spirits; cheerful emotions of the mind are first produced,
the countenance becomes flushed, involuntary words and actions follow,
and sometimes at last an entire loss of consciousness. It renders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
some remarkably active, and proves highly stimulating to muscular
exertion. By too large a dose violent spasmodic effects are produced.
So very exciting to the nervous system in some individuals is this
fungus that the effects are often very ludicrous. If a person under its
influence wishes to step over a straw or a small stick, he takes a stride
or a jump sufficient to clear the trunk of a tree. A talkative person
cannot keep silence or secrets, and one fond of music is perpetually
singing.</p>

<p>“The most singular effect of the <i>Amanita</i> is the influence it possesses
over the urine. It is said that from time immemorial the inhabitants
have known that the fungus imparts an intoxicating quality to that
secretion, which continues for a considerable time after taking it. For
instance, a man moderately intoxicated to-day will by the next morning
have slept himself sober; but (as is the custom) by taking a cup
of his urine he will be more powerfully intoxicated than he was the preceding
day. It is therefore not uncommon for confirmed drunkards to
preserve their urine as a precious liquor against a scarcity of the
fungus.</p>

<p>“The intoxicating property of the urine is capable of being propagated,
for every one who partakes of it has his urine similarly affected.
Thus with a very few <i>Amanitæ</i> a party of drunkards may keep up
their debauch for a week. Dr. Langsdorf mentions that by means of
the second person taking the urine of the first, the third of the second,
and so on, the intoxication may be propagated through five individuals.”—(English Cyclop.,
London, 1854, vol ii., “Natural History,” article
“Fungi.” London: Bradbury and Evans.)</p>

<p>“They make feasts when one village entertains another, either upon
account of a wedding, or having had a plentiful fishing or hunting.
The landlords entertain their guests with great bowls of oponga, till
they are all set a-vomiting; sometimes they use a liquor made of a
large mushroom, with which the Russians kill flies. This they prepare
with the juice of epilobium or French willow. The first symptom of a
man being affected with this liquor is a trembling in all his joints, and
in half an hour he begins to rave as if in a fever; and is either merry
or melancholy mad according to his peculiar constitution. Some jump,
dance, and sing; others weep and are in terrible agonies, a small hole
appearing to them as a great pit, and a spoonful of water as a lake;
but this is to be understood of those who take it to excess; for, taken
in small quantity, it raises their spirits, and makes them brisk, courageous,
and cheerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“It is observed whenever they have eaten of this plant, they maintain
that whatever foolish things they did, they only obeyed the commands
of the mushroom; however, the use of it is so dangerous that
unless they were well looked after, it would be the destruction of numbers
of them. The Kamtchadales do not much care to relate these
drunken frolics, and perhaps the continual use of it renders it less
dangerous to them. One of our Cossacks resolved to eat of this mushroom
in order to surprise his comrades, and this he actually did; but
it was with great difficulty they preserved his life. Another of the
inhabitants of Kamtchatka, by the use of this mushroom, imagined
that he was upon the brink of hell ready to be thrown in, and that the
mushroom ordered him to fall on his knees and make a full confession
of all the sins he could remember, which he did before a great number
of his comrades, to their no small diversion. It is related that a
soldier of the garrison, having eaten a little of this mushroom, walked
a great way without any fatigue; but at last, having taken too great a
quantity, he died.</p>

<p>“My interpreter drank some of this juice without knowing of it, and
became so mad that it was with difficulty we kept him from ripping
open his belly, being, as he said, ordered to do so by the mushroom.</p>

<p>“The Kamtchadales and the Koreki eat of it when they resolve to
murder anybody; and it is in such esteem among the Koreki that they
do not allow any one that is drunk with it to make water upon the
ground, but they give him a vessel to save his urine in, which they
drink; and it has the same effect as the mushroom itself.</p>

<p>“None of this mushroom grows in their country, so that they are
obliged to purchase it of the Kamtchadales. Three or four of them
are a moderate dose, but when they want to get drunk they take ten.
The women never use it, so that all their merriment consists in
jesting, dancing, and singing.”—(“The History of Kamtchatka and
the Kurile Islands,” by James Grieve, M.D., Gloucester, England,
1764, pp. 207-209.)</p>

<p>“I do not think that the urine would keep very long, and decomposition
would destroy the Amanitine, which I believe to be the intoxicating
principle. If I remember aright, it has been obtained as an
alkaloid.”—(Personal letter from Dr. J. W. Kingsley, Cambridge,
England, dated Aug. 18, 1888.)</p>

<p>“If the Yakut was a good and loving spouse, he would go directly
home and eject the contents of his stomach into a vessel of water,
which then he placed out of doors to cool and collect; and from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
rich, floating vomit his wife and children would afterwards enjoy a
hearty meal. The lucky possessor of a stomach full of Vodki may, in
a benevolent mood, similarly dispose of a part of his repletion, minus
the water, and away to the Eastward, among the Tchuchees, families
are often regaled even to inebriation with the natural fluid discharge
from the bodies of fortunate tipplers.... Saving the natives themselves
it is their most disgusting institution, and if any Christian missionary
be earnestly seeking a fresh field to labor in, I can assure him
that no soil is more desperately in need of cultivation than the Tchuchee
Country.”—(“In the Lena Delta,” George W. Melville, Chief Engineer,
U. S. Navy, Boston, Massachusetts, 1885, page 318.)</p>

<p>“<i>Amanita muscaria</i> has been employed as fly-poison, whence its vulgar
name. M. Poquet states that climate does not modify its poisonous
qualities. The Czar Alexis died from eating it, yet the Kamtchatkans
eat it, or are said to do so, as also the Russians. In Siberia, it is used as
an intoxicating agent. Cook says it is taken as a bolus, and that its
effects combine those produced by alcohol and haschish. The property
is imparted to the fluid secretion (urine) of rendering it intoxicating,
which property it retains for a considerable time. A man, having
been intoxicated on one day and slept himself sober the next, will, by
drinking this liquor to the extent of about a cupful, become as much
intoxicated as he was before.... Urine is preserved in Siberia to this
end.... The intoxicating property may be communicated to any person
who partakes ... to the third, fourth, and even fifth distillation.”—(M.
C. Cook, “British Fungi,” London, 1882, pp. 21, 22.)</p>

<p>Henry Lamsdell (“Through Siberia,” London, 1882, vol. ii. p. 645)
describes the “fly agaric.” He says that it is used by the Koraks to
produce intoxication. “So powerful is the fungus that the native who
eats it remains drunk for several days; and by a process too disgusting
to be described, half a dozen individuals may be successively intoxicated
by the effects of a single mushroom, each in a less degree than
his predecessor.”</p>

<p>“The Koraks prepare the ‘muk-a-moor’ by steeping it. In a few
minutes the fortunate ones get thoroughly intoxicated, and imbibe to
such an extent that they are forced to relieve themselves of the superfluity,
on which occasions the poorer people stand prepared with bowls
to catch the liquid, which they quaff, and, in turn, become intoxicated.
In this manner, a whole settlement will sometimes get drunk from
liquor consumed by one individual.”—(Richard J. Bush, “Reindeer,
Dogs and Snow-Shoes,” London, no date, p. 357.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Salverte gives two pages to a description of the effects of the “fly
agaric” or “mucha-more” of the Russians; he shows how it leads men
to the commission of murder, suicide, and other excesses, but makes
no allusion to the drinking of urine, although he quotes from Gmelin,
Krachenninikof and Beniowski, all of whom must have had some acquaintance
with its peculiar properties. According to Salverte the use
of this fungus might well be referred to the category of Sacred Intoxicants.—(See
“Philosophy of Magic,” Eusèbe Salverte, New York, 1862,
vol. ii. pp. 19, 20.)</p>

<p>“Before the conquest, they seldom used anything for drink but
water, but when they made merry they drank water which had stood
for some time upon mushrooms; but of this more hereafter.”—(“History
of Kamtchatka and the Kurile Islands,” James Grieve, M. D.,
Gloucester, England, 1764, p. 195.)</p>

<p>See previous citation from the same author.</p>

<p>A mere reference to the trade carried on by the Russians and Kamtchadales
with the Koraks in <i>Agaricus muscarius</i> is to be found in
“Langsdorf’s Voyages,” London, 1814, vol. ii. p. 318. “It is said that
the sort of mushroom which they procure from Kamtchadales is preferred
by them as a means of exhilaration or intoxication to brandy.”
(Idem, p. 320.) He adds: “Some remarks of mine upon this subject
will be found in the Annals of the Society for promoting the
Knowledge of Natural History.”—(Idem, p. 321.)</p>

<p>“The use of the intoxicating fungus in Siberia, and that of the urine
flavored by it, is mentioned in Steller’s ‘History of Kamtchatka,’
which is, I believe, the earliest and best authority in reference to it.”—(Personal
letter from Hon. John S. Hittell, San Francisco, April
24, 1888.)</p>

<p>Although Grieve’s account is, in the main, derived from Steller,
every effort was made to find the latter author and examine his own
language. The copy belonging to the Library of Congress had been mislaid,
and it was not possible to find it; but the extensive Arctic Library
of General A. W. Greely, U. S. Army, the polar explorer, was
most kindly placed at the author’s disposal, and there the long-coveted
volume was, translated by Mr. Bunnemeyer, to whom the warmest
acknowledgments are due.</p>

<p>George William Steller was born March 10, 1709, at Winsheim.
In 1734, he went to Russia, where he became an adjunct and member
of The Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1758, he was delegated
to explore Kamtchatka, especially its natural history. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
completing the task and making voyages to various other regions,
he attempted twice to return to St. Petersburgh, but each time received
orders to return to Irkutsk to answer charges there brought
against him. He did not reach Irkutsk the second time, but was frozen
to death while his guard entered a way-side inn, and was buried at
Tumen, in November, 1746. The following are his remarks about
poisonous mushrooms: “Among the Champignons, the poisonous toadstool,
called mucha-moor in Russian, is held in greatest esteem. At
the Russian ostrag it has long ago fallen into disfavor, but is used so
much the more in the vicinity of the Tzil and towards the Korakian
boundary. This mushroom is dried and swallowed in large pieces without
mastication, followed by large draughts of cold water. In the
course of half an hour, raging drunkenness and strange hallucinations
result. The Korakians and Jukagiri are still more addicted to
this vice, and buy the fungus from the Russians whenever they can.
Those too poor to do so collect the urine of those under the influence
of the drug and drink it, which makes them equally as drunk and
raging.</p>

<p>“The urine is equally effective to the fourth and fifth man. Reindeer
frequently devour these mushrooms with great avidity, becoming
drunk and wild, and finally fall into a deep sleep. When found in this
state, it is not killed until the effects of the drug have passed away, as
otherwise its meat when eaten will cause the same frenzied intoxication
as the mushroom itself.”</p>

<p>“The dance and custom you describe as existing among the Siberians
I know nothing of. I neither saw nor heard of it. I do not
think there is any of the mushroom species in the Tchuktchi country.
The land is absolutely barren. I lived in the tents of that people for
seven or eight months, and they never paid any attention to me as a
stranger, in the way of hiding their customs from me. They would
have their drumming and medicine performances before me, just as
though I was one of them. The custom you allude to may prevail
among the Yakouts and Tchuktchi, nevertheless, but I think it more
probable that it exists with the Northwest tribes, such as the Samoyeds
or Osjaks.”—(Personal letter from the Arctic explorer, W. H.
Gilder, author of “Schwatka’s Search,” etc., dated New York,
Oct. 15, 1889.)</p>

<p>“Captain Healey, of the revenue cutter ‘Bear,’ brought to this
place, last autumn, a shipwrecked seaman, who had been rescued by
the Siberian Tchuktchis, with whom he remained some two years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
He described their mode of making an intoxicating liquor thus: in
the summer, mushrooms or fungi were collected in large quantity, and
eaten by a man who, like our Indians, prepared himself by fasting for
the feast. After eating enormous quantities of the fungi, he vomited
into a receptacle, and again loaded up, time and again, and disgorged
the stuff in a semi-fermented or half-digested condition. It was swallowed
by those who were waiting for the drink; and his urine was
also imbibed, to aid in producing a debauch, resulting in frenzied
intoxication.”—(Personal letter from Surgeon B. J. D. Irwin, U. S.
army, dated San Francisco, Cal., April 28, 1888.)</p>

<p>“The seaman, J. B. Vincent, whom I found with the Tchuktchi last
summer, says that they collect in their tents a species of fungi, and
during their carnival season, corresponding to about our Christmas
holidays, one man is selected, who masticates a quantity of it, and
drinks an enormous supply of water; he then gets into his deer’s
team, and is driven from camp to camp, repeating the mastication and
drinking at each camp, where his urine is drunk by the people with
an effect of intoxication. The arrival of this man is hailed with
much pomp and ceremony by the people. The seaman, Vincent,
witnessed several of these ceremonies, and was pressed to join in the
orgies, being called ‘a boy,’ when he declined to sustain his part.”—(Personal
letter from Capt. M. A. Healey, U. S. R. M. Steamer
“Bear,” dated San Francisco, Cal., May 19, 1888.)</p>

<p>Kamtchadales.—“These people formerly had no other drink than
water, and to make themselves a little lively they used to drink an
infusion of mushrooms.”—(“From Paris to Pekin,” Meignan, London,
1885, p. 281.)</p>

<p>D’Auteroche, who made a journey from St. Petersburgh to Tobolsk
in Siberia, in compliance with an invitation from the Empress Catherine,
in the middle of the last century, to observe the transit of
Venus, makes no mention of the mushroom-orgies of the natives.
His work was not of much value, in an ethnological sense, being
largely restricted to descriptions of the mineral resources of the regions
traversed, and only to a slight degree attending to the ethnology of
the country.</p>

<p>It is strange that Maltebrun, although familiar with Steller, does
not refer to the mushroom orgy. He does say of the Kamtchadales:
“In summer, the women go into the woods to gather vegetables, and
during this occupation they give way to a libertine frenzy like that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of the ancient Bacchantes.”—(“Universal Geography,” American
edition, Boston, Mass., 1847, vol. i. p. 347, article “Siberia.”)</p>

<p>Stanley’s “Congo,” New York, 1885, was examined carefully, but
no reference to any use of urine or ordure was found in it.</p>

<p>An identical experience was had with the “Voyages” of John
Struys, translated out of the Dutch, by John Morrison, London, 1683,
and with Nordjenskold’s Voyages, translated by Horgaard, London,
1882.</p>

<p>As the two latter travellers had entered Siberia, it seemed probable
that they might have come upon traces of the Ur-orgies of some of
the wild tribes like the Koraks, Tchuktchi, and others.</p>

<p>Salverte’s opinion that this use of the mushroom may be included
in the category of Sacred Intoxicants, is shown to be accurate by
a comparison with the statement made by the shipwrecked sailor,
Vincent, who undoubtedly may be accepted as the most competent
witness who has ever presented himself.</p>

<p>According to him, there was a man “selected,” who “prepared
himself by fasting;” the “feast” took place “during their carnival
season,” “corresponding to about our Christmas holidays” (i. e., the
winter solstice), and there was much attendant “pomp and ceremony.”
Add to this the statement made by Grieve, “they maintain that whatever
foolish things they did, they only obeyed the commands of the
mushroom,” and we have the needed Personification to prove that
the fungus was reverenced as a deity, much as on another page will
be shown that certain African tribes apotheosized a member of the
same vegetable family.</p>

<p>If not for Sacred Intoxication, then the question may be asked, For
what reason did the Siberians and others use the poisonous fungus?
The only answer possible is, that, in the absence of the cereals and
under the pressure of a desire for stimulants, the aborigines resorted
to all kinds of vegetable substances, as can be shown to have been the
case from the history of many nations. Mythology is replete with
examples of the occult virtues of plants, such as the mandrake
and many others.</p>

<p>Certainly, the religious veneration with which they were regarded
was not more fully deserved than by this wonderful toxic,—the <i>Amanita
muscaria</i>. The thirst for stimulants has been very generally
diffused all over the world; there is no reason to believe that any
tribe has existed without an occasional use of something of the kind.</p>

<p>According to the Chinese, an alcoholic liquor called “Tsew” was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
invented by Etoih, in the reign of To-ke, 2197 before the Christian
era. See “Chinese Repository,” Canton, 1841, vol. x. p. 126.</p>

<p>Mr. John McElhone, the stenographer of the House of Representatives
and a scholar of no mean attainments, stated to the author that
he remembered having read in an old volume, the name of which he
could not recall, of a feast given some centuries ago at the coronation
of one of the kings of Hungary, at which the nobles were regaled
with the rarest wines, but the plebeians were content to drink the
resulting urine. There may be in Hungary, whether we regard it as
peopled by the Hun-oi, or, later, by the Turkish element, an infusion
of the same race-traits as are to be found at this day in Kamtchatka
and other portions of Siberia.</p>

<p>Salverte speaks of the intoxicating effects of the “muk-a-moor,” but
enters into no particulars. (See “Philosophy of Magic,” Eusebe
Salverte, New York, 1882, vol. ii. p. 19.)</p>

<p>The people of Kamtchatka make intoxicants out of certain herbs.
(Steller, “Kamtchatka,” translated by Mr. Bunnemeyer.) And we
are further told that, while the people are gathering these herbs, much
prostitution prevails, and everywhere there are willing girls in the
grass.</p>

<p>“The settled Koraks” of Kamtchatka, “eat the intoxicating Siberian
toadstool in inordinate quantities; and this habit alone will in time
debase and brutalize any body of men to the last degree.”—(“Tent
Life in Siberia,” George Kennan, twelfth edition, New York, 1887,
p. 233.)</p>

<p>No allusion to the use of mushrooms as an intoxicant can be found
in Sauer, “Expedition to the North Parts of Russia,” London, 1862.
Henry Seebohm (“Siberia in Asia,” London, 1882) makes no mention
of the urine-orgies of the inhabitants.</p>

<h3>THE MUSHROOM DRINK OF THE BORGIE WELL.</h3>

<p>The following paragraph deserves more than a passing mention:—</p>

<p>“The Borgie well, at Cambuslang, near Glasgow, is credited with
making mad those who drink from it; according to the local rhyme,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘A drink of the Borgie, a bite of the weed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sets a’ the Cam’slang folk wrang in the head.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The weed is the weedy fungi.”—(“Folk-Medicine,” Black, London,
1883, p. 104.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Camden says that the Irish “delight in herbs, ... especially
cresses, mushrooms, and roots.”—(“Britannia,” edition of London,
1753, vol. ii. p. 1422.)</p>

<p>Other references to the Siberian fungus are inserted to afford students
the fullest possible opportunity to understand all that was
available to the author himself on this point.</p>

<p>“<i>Agaricus muscarius</i> is one of the most injurious, yet it is used as a
means of intoxication by the Kamtchadales. One or two of them are
sufficient to produce a slight intoxication, which is peculiar in its character.
It stimulates the muscular powers and greatly excites the
nervous system, leading the partakers into the most ridiculous extravagances.”—(American
Cyclopædia, New York, 1881, article
“Fungi.”)</p>

<p><i>Agaricus muscarius.</i> “This is the ‘mouche-more’ of the Russians,
Kamtchadales, and Koriars, who use it for intoxication. They sometimes
eat it dry, and sometimes immerse it in a liquor made with the
epilobium, and when they drink this liquor they are seized with convulsions
in all their limbs, followed by that kind of raving which attends
a burning fever. They personify this mushroom, and if they
are urged by its effects to suicide or any dreadful crime, they pretend
to obey its commands. To fit themselves for premeditated assassination
they recur to the use of the ‘mouche-more.’ A powder of the
root, or of that part of the stem which is covered by the earth, is recommended
in epileptic cases, and externally applied for dissipating hard,
globular swellings and for healing ulcers.”—(Cyclopædia, Philadelphia,
no date, Samuel Bradford, vol. i. article “Agaric.”)</p>

<p>“One of the most poisonous species of the genus is the ‘fly agaric,’
so named because the fungus is often steeped and the solution used for
the destruction of the house-fly.... It is as attractive and as
poisonous as it is beautiful. In Kamtchatka, it is highly prized for its
poisonous properties, producing, as it does, in the eater a peculiar intoxication.
The fungus is gathered and dried; and when a native
wishes to engage in a debauch, he has but to swallow a piece, when in
a few hours he will be in his glory.”—(Johnson’s New Universal Cyclopædia,
New York, 1878, article “Mushroom.”)</p>

<p>Poisonous fungi. “Several of this natural order are poisonous, especially
those belonging to the genera <i>Amanita</i> and <i>Agaricus</i>....
The sufferers are often relieved by vomiting.”—(Encyclopædia Britannica,
edition of 1841, article “Medical Jurisprudence,” vol. xiv. pp. 506,
507.) Speaking of the poisonous fungi, the same authority says:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
“The effects are singularly various, ... among them being giddiness,
confusion, delirium, stupor, coma, and convulsions.”—(Idem, vol. xviii.
p. 178, article “Poison.”)</p>

<p>“The boletus mentioned by Juvenal on account of the death of the
Emperor Claudius.”—(Cyclopædia, Philadelphia, no date, vol. xxv.
article “Mushroom.”)</p>

<p>There are several allusions to the custom of poisoning with mushrooms
to be found in Juvenal,—for example, in the first and fifth
satires.</p>

<p>Tacitus says that when Claudius was poisoned the poison “was
poured into a dish of mushrooms.”—(“Annals,” Oxford translation,
Bohn, London, 1871, lib. 12.)</p>

<p>After the Emperor Claudius had been poisoned by mushrooms given
by his wife Messalina, the Emperor Nero, his successor, was wont to
call the boletus “the food of the gods.” (See footnote to Rev. Lewis
Evans’s translation of the sixth satire of Juvenal, p. 64, edition of New
York, 1860, citing Suetonius’s “Nero,” Tacitus’s “Annals,” and Martial’s
“Epigrams,” I. epistle XXI.)</p>

<p>Plutarch says that it was a common opinion that “thunder engenders
mushrooms.”—(“Morals,” Goodwin’s English edition, Boston,
1870, vol. iii. p. 298.)</p>

<p>Gilder, who crossed over Siberia from Behring’s Straits to St. Petersburgh,
stopping <i>en route</i> with many of the wild tribes, makes no allusion
to the use of the “muck-a-moor” or to any Ur-orgy. (See
“Ice-pack and Tundra,” New York, 1883.)</p>

<p>“The <i>Agaricus muscarius</i> is used by the natives of Kamtchatka
and Korea to produce intoxication.”—(Ure’s “Dictionary of Arts,
Manufactures, and Mines,” London, 1878, vol. ii. article “Fungi.”)</p>

<p>“Their reputation as aphrodisiacs is thought to be unfounded,
having its origin in the old doctrine of resemblances.” (American
Cyclopædia, New York, 1881, article “Fungi.”) Probably from the
appearance of the “phallus” fungus.</p>

<p>There seems to have been some superstition attaching to the elder
dating from very remote times. It is said in Gerrard’s “Herbal,”
Johnson’s edition, page 1428, “that the <i>arbor Judæ</i> is thought to be
that whereon Judas hanged himself, and not upon the elder-tree, as is
vulgarly said.” I am clear that the mushrooms or excrescences of the
elder-tree, called <i>auriculæ Judæ</i> in Latin, and commonly rendered
“Jew’s-ears,” ought to be translated “Judas’s-ears,” from the popular
superstition above mentioned. Coles, in his “Adam in Eden,” speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of “Jew’s-ears,” says: “It is called in Latin <i>Fungus Sambucinum</i>
and <i>Auriculæ Judæ</i>, some having supposed the elder-tree to be that
whereon Judas hanged himself, and that ever since these mushrooms
like unto ears have grown thereon, which I will not persuade you to
believe.” In “Paradoxical Assertions,” is a silly question,—“why
Jews are said to stink naturally. Is it because the ‘Jew’s ears’ grow
on stinking elder, which tree the fox-headed Judas was supposed to
have hanged himself on, so that natural stink hath been entailed on
them and their posterity as it were <i>ex traduce</i>? The elder seems to
have been given in the time of Queen Elizabeth as a token of
disgrace. It was credited with the power to cure epilepsy, to
strengthen the loins of men, especially in riding, as it prevented all
gall and chafing, etc., and had additionally the property of making
horses stale.”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872, vol. iii.
p. 283, article “Physical Charms.”)</p>

<p><i>Sambucus</i> (elder) is mentioned by Frommann as a remedy for epilepsy.—(“Tractatus
de Fascinatione,” Nuremberg, 1675, p. 270.)</p>

<p>Have we not a right to inquire why in primitive pharmacy certain
remedies were employed? The principle of <i>similia similibus</i> is very
old and deeply rooted. Perhaps the fungus of the elder may have
once been employed in inducing intoxication and frenzy.</p>

<p>“The Ostiaks, the Kamtchadales, and other inhabitants of Asiatic
Russia, find in one of the gild-bearing family—the <i>Amanita muscaria</i>—the
exhilaration and madness that more civilized nations demand and
receive of alcohol, and enjoy a narcotism from its extracts as seductive
as that of opium. The Fiji Islanders are indebted to toadstools strung on
a string for girdles which alone prevent them from being classed among
the ‘poor and naked,’ and their sole æsthetic occupation lies in ornamenting
their limited wardrobe. The Fiji fishermen especially value
them highly because they are water-proof. Cerdier tells us that the negroes
on the west coast of Africa exalt a certain kind of boletus to the
sacredness of a god, and bow down in worship before it; for this reason
Afzeltus has named this variety <i>boletus sacer</i>. A French chemist has
extracted wax from the milk-giving kind, but has not stated the price
of candles made from it. Others of the delving fraternity have shown
that toadstools may be used in the manufacture of Prussian blue instead
of blood, for, like certain animal matter, they furnish prussic
acid. As fungi, after the manner of all animal life, breathe oxygen and
throw off carbonic acid gas, their flesh partakes of animal rather than
of vegetable nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“In their decomposition they are capital fertilizers of surrounding
plants, and in seasons when they are plentiful it will repay the agriculturist
to make use of them as manure.</p>

<p>“According to Linnæus, the Lapps delighted in the perfume of some
species, and carried them upon their persons so that they might be the
more attractive. Linnæus exclaims, ‘O Venus! thou that scarcely
sufficest thyself in other countries with jewels, diamonds, precious
stones, gold, purple, music, and spectacle, art here satisfied with a
simple toadstool!’</p>

<p>“A variety of boletus—a tube-bearing species—is powdered, and
used as a protector of clothing against insects. The <i>Agaricus muscarius</i>
constitutes a well-known poison to the common house-fly. It
intoxicates them to such a degree that they can be swept up and destroyed.</p>

<p>“Certain polypori—those large, dry, corky growths found upon
logs and trees—when properly seasoned, sliced, and beaten, engage
large manufactories in producing from them the punk of commerce,
used by the surgeon for the arrest of hemorrhage, the artist for his
shading stump, and the Fourth of July urchin for his pyrotechnic
purposes. A species of polyporus is used in Italy as scrubbing
brushes. In countries where fire-producing is unknown or laborious,
and the luxury of lucifers denied, the dried fungus enables the transportation
of fire from one place to another over great distances.</p>

<p>“The inhabitants of Franconia use the hammered slices instead of
chamois-skin for underclothing.</p>

<p>“Another polyporus takes its place among manufacturers as the highly
necessary razor-strop. Northern nations make bottle-stoppers of them,
as their corky nature suggests. The polyporus of the birch-tree (<i>Polyporus
betulinus</i>) increases the delight of smokers by its delicious flavor
when mixed with tobacco.”—(Lippincott’s Magazine, Philadelphia,
Penn., 1888.)</p>

<p>Before going further we are confronted with the statement that the
African negroes bow down in worship before a certain kind of boletus.
It is much to be regretted that Cerdier did not discover for what toxic
or other property it was thus apotheosized.</p>

<p>Similarly, scholars cannot remain satisfied with the assurance that
the Fiji Islanders use toadstools for girdles only, or that the Lapps
carried other varieties upon their persons to enhance their personal
attractions. Some aphrodisiac potency is more likely to have been
ascribed to them in each case, which would account for the care displayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
in their preservation, and justify the suspicion that they were
kept ready to hand as provocatives to lust.</p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Porter is authority for the statement that in one of the
Sagas mention is made of a man bewitched by a Lapland witch,
who gave him an infusion of poisonous mushroom, which set him
crazy.</p>

<p>“Lichens,” says De Candolle, “present two classes of properties,
which are developed by different agents, and especially by maceration
in urine.”—(Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. v. edition of 1841.)</p>

<p>There is an example of the employment of mushrooms in medicine
for the stoppage of hemorrhages of various kinds, which can be traced
back to the writings of Hippocrates.—(See “Saxon Leechdoms,”
vol. iii. p. 143.)</p>

<p>“Some species of mushrooms, notably the <i>Agaricus volvaceus</i> contain
sugar, which can be extracted in crystals, and is capable of undergoing
the vinous fermentation.”—(Encyclopædia Britannica, edition
of 1841, vol. vi. pp. 473, 474, article “Chemistry.”)</p>

<p>No instance of anything resembling the Ur-Orgy of the Siberians
has been described among the Australians, but there is no knowing
what further investigation may discover of the life and mode of
thought of the wild tribes inhabiting that great continent, or island,
as the reader pleases.</p>

<p>“The Australians will not eat ‘the common mushroom,’ although
they eat almost all other kinds of fungus.”—(“The Native Tribes of
South Australia,” Adelaide, 1879, received through the kindness of
the Royal Society, Sydney, New South Wales, T. B. Kyngdon, Esq.,
Secretary.)</p>

<p>“Fungi, however, were used for food. The native truffle,—‘<i>Mylitta
Australis</i>,’—a subterranean fungus,—was much sought after by
the natives. When cut, it is in appearance somewhat like unbaked
brown bread. I have seen large pieces, weighing several pounds, and,
in some localities, occasionally a fungus weighing fifty pounds is
found.”—(“Aborigines of Victoria,” A. Brough Smyth, London, 1878,
vol. i. p. 209.)</p>

<p>“Mushrooms, called by the Chinese ‘stones’ ears,’ are gathered by
some for the table, and form a part of the vegetable diet of the
priests.”—(Chinese Repository, Canton, 1835, vol. iii. p. 462.)</p>

<p>But why the diet of priests particularly? May there not be some
mythical precept involved?</p>

<p>(Monbottoes of Africa.) “Mushrooms are also in common use for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the preparation of their sauces.”—(Schweinfurth’s “Heart of Africa,”
London, 1878, vol. ii. p. 42.)</p>

<p>“There is a great variety of mushrooms, most of which are eat.
Some, indeed, are poisonous, and unlucky accidents happen frequently.”—(Kemper,
“History of Japan,” in “Pinkerton’s Voyages,”
London, 1814, vol. vii. p. 698.)</p>

<p>A. Brough Smyth, “Aborigines of Australia,” p. 132, speaks of the
use by the Australians of “a dry, white species of fungus, to kindle
fire with rapidly.”</p>

<p>Agaric. “It groweth in Fraunce, principally upon trees that bear
mast, in manner of a white mushroom; of a sweet savour; very effectual
in Physicke and used in many Antidotes and sovereigne confections.
It groweth upon the head and top of trees, it shineth in the
night, and by the light that it giveth in the dark men know when and
how to gather it.”—(Pliny, lib. xvi. cap. 8, Holland’s translation.)</p>

<p>“On mange généralement en Russie toutes les espèces de champignons;”
but the “champignon de mouche,” and two other kinds, are
excepted.—(See “Voyages,”—Pallas, Paris, 1793, vol. i. p. 65.)</p>

<p>“The Ostiaks of Siberia make a ‘moxa’ of ’un morceau d’agaric du
bouleau.’”—(Idem, vol. iv. p. 68.)</p>

<p>Bogle enumerates mushrooms among the articles of diet of the
Lamas.—(See Markham’s “Thibet,” London, 1879, p. 105.)</p>

<p>“Mushrooms and fungi of all kinds are eaten by the Bongo of the
Upper Nile region.”—(See “Heart of Africa,” Schweinfurth, London,
1878, vol. i. pp. 117-122.)</p>

<p>“The Niam-Niams of Central Africa use fungi for foods.”—(Idem,
p. 281.)</p>

<p>In a synopsis of the lecture delivered by the explorer Stanley before
the Royal Geographical Society in London, he is represented as referring
to the skill of the Niam-Niam in woodcraft, and the ability
with which they detected the edible fungi from the poisonous.—(See
“Tribune,” Chicago, Ill., June 28, 1890.)</p>

<p>Agaric. Avicenna believed that the white, or “feminine,” was
good, the black, or “masculine,” noxious; it was prescribed for epilepsy,
fevers, sciatica, asthma, pulmonary troubles, etc. (Avicenna,
vol. i. p. 278, improperly numbered in the book as p. 287, a 10, <i>et seq.</i>)
It also entered into a number of panaceas, such as “Theriaca,” “Theodoricon
Magnum,” “Mithradatum,” and others.</p>

<p>It was a provocative of the menses, according to Avicenna, vol. i.
p. 287, a 54.</p>

<p>Thurnberg mentions a plant—“Bupleorum giganteum”—found in
Cape Colony, of which clothing was made, and which was also used
for tinder.—(See Pinkerton’s Voyages, London, 1814, vol. xvi. pp. 21,
22, quoting Thurnberg’s “Account of the Cape of Good Hope.”)</p>

account of the Behring Voyage.)</p>

<p>There are some varieties of agaric, notably that of the olive-tree,
which at times emit by night a phosphorescent light. This peculiarity
may well have caused them to be regarded with reverential awe by the
ancients. On the subject of this effulgence, see “Philosophy of
Magic,” Eusèbe Salverte, New York, 1862, vol. i. p. 63.</p>

<p>Pope Clement VII. died of eating too many mushrooms. See Schurig’s
“Chylologia,” Dresden, 1725, vol. i. p. 60.</p>

<p>(Tierra del Fuego.) “There is one vegetable production in this
country which is worthy of mention, as it affords a staple article of
food to the natives. It is a globular fungus, of a bright yellow color,
and of about the size of a small apple, which adheres in vast numbers
to the bark of the beech-trees.... It is eaten by the Fuegians in
large quantities, uncooked, and when well chewed has a mucilaginous
and slightly sweet taste, together with a faint odor like that of a
mushroom. Excepting a few berries of a dwarf arbutus, which need
hardly be taken into account, these poor savages never eat any other
vegetable food besides this fungus.”—(Darwin, in “Voyage of Adventure
and Beagle,” London, 1839, vol. iii. pp. 298, 299.)</p>

<p>“These Fuegians appeared to think the excrescences which grow on
the birch-trees, like the gall-nuts on an oak, an estimable dainty.”—(Idem,
vol. i. p. 440; again, vol. ii. p. 185.)</p>

<p>Agaric, or toadstool, employed in medicine “to provoke to vomit”
(see “Most Excellent and Approved Medicines,” London, 1654, pp. 3
and 10); also given “for provoking the courses” (idem, p. 23); also
“to loosen the body” (idem, p. 36).</p>

<p>To insure conception, the belief was that both man and woman
should take a potion of hare’s rennet in wine,—“then quickly she
will be pregnant, and for meat she shall for some while eat mushrooms.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 347.)</p>

<p>The Bannocks and Shoshonees of the Rocky Mountains eat mushrooms,—“the
kind that grows on a cottonwood stump; they know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
that some kinds are bad.”—(Interview with the Bannocks and Shoshonees,

<span class="smaller">THE MUSHROOM IN CONNECTION WITH THE FAIRIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the opinion of the folk of Great Britain and Ireland, possibly of
the Continent as well, the mushroom was intimately connected
with the dwellers in the realm of sprites and fairies, as can be shown
in a moment, and by simple reference.</p>

<p>The lore of the peasantry of those countries is replete with the
uncanniness of the “Fairy Circles,” which modern investigation has
shown to be due to a species of fungus.</p>

<p>“Various theories were current among the peasantry to account for
their existence. Some of them ascribed them to lightning; others to
moles or other animals; and others again to the growth of a species
of fungus. This is the more educated class. But the lower orders
implicitly believed that they were the work of the fairies, and used by
them for their nocturnal dancing. Woe to the poor mortal who ventured
near at such moments. He was seized, forced to dance, soon
lost all consciousness, and was truly in luck if he ever again succeeded
in rejoining his mortal relatives.” A very exhaustive account of
these Circles, and the superstitions in reference to them, is to be
found in the third volume of Brand’s Popular Antiquities, London,
1854, article “Fairy Mythology,” p. 476 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>“The most clear and satisfactory remarks on the origin of fairy
rings are probably those of Dr. Wollaston, Sec. R. S., printed in the
second part of the “Philosophical Transactions” for 1807.... The
cause of their appearance he ascribes to the growth of certain species
of agaric, which so entirely absorbs all nutriment from the soil beneath
that the herbage is for a while destroyed.”—(Idem, p. 483.)</p>

<p>“In Northumberland, the common people call a certain fungous
excrescence, sometimes found about the roots of old trees, Fairy Butter.
After great rains, and in a certain degree of putrefaction, it is
reduced to a consistency which, together with its color, makes it not
unlike butter, and hence the name.”—(Idem, p. 493.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>Lady Wilde’s work, already quoted, makes no reference to the
employment of either mushrooms or mistletoe by the Irish peasantry.</p>

<p>The mixing, in the popular imagination, of Fairies and Druids, of
Fairy Circles and the Druid Circles, is noticed on p. 505, Brand, art.
“Fairy Mythology.”</p>

<p>Perhaps in all this there may be a vague reminiscence of a former
use of the agaric in potions not very dissimilar to those still to be
found among the Koraks and Tchuktchi. We read that this Witches’
Butter was associated with sorcery. It was believed in Sweden to
have been “spewed up” by the cat which went with the witch.—(See
Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872, vol. iii. p. 7, article
“Sorcery.”)</p>

<p>“No subject could be more interesting than an inquiry into the
origin of the superstitions of uncivilized tribes.” (“Philosophy of
Magic,” Salverte, vol. i. p. 138.) Salverte remarks that the Fairies
“were supposed to be diminutive, aerial beings, beautiful, lively,
and beneficent in their intercourse with mortals, inhabiting a region
called Fairy Land,—Alf-Heiner,—commonly appearing on earth
at intervals, when they left traces of their visits in beautiful green
rings, where the dewy sward had been trodden in their moon-light
dances.... The investigations of science have traced these rings
to a species of fungus,—<i>Agaricus oreades</i>,—but imagination still
leads us willingly back to the traditional appearance of these diminutive
beings in the train of their queen; ... and we also behold her
tiny followers dancing away the midnight hours to the sound of the
most enchanting music.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 138, footnote.)</p>

<p>There is the following memorandum in Hazlitt’s “Fairy Tales”
(London, 1875, p. 35): “Mem., that pigeon’s-dung and nitre steeped
in water will make the fayry circles; it draws to it the nitre of the
air, and it will never weare out.”</p>

<p>A careful search of Shakspeare shows that while perhaps he knew
little directly to our purpose, he still had a knowledge that we may

that it was an element of midnight revels of the fairies; he alludes to
customs which certainly suggest that slaves and criminals were in
early days buried beneath dung-heaps as a punishment; and he can

<p>The concordance consulted was that of the Clarkes.</p>

<p>The association of “toadstools” with witchcraft may have been due
to the belief that toads were the constant companions and servants of
the witches and fairies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>Gesner says that witches made use of toads as a charm, “ut vim
coeundi, ni fallor, in viris tollerunt.”—(Brand, Pop. Ant. London,
1872, vol. ii. page 170, art. “Divination at Weddings.”)</p>

<p>“Un crapaud noir de venin” was to be employed by those seeking
favor of the witches of “Les Bourbonnais,” “La Fascination.”—(J.
Tuchmann, in “Mélusine,” Paris, July, August, 1890.)</p>

<p>May dew was considered a most beneficial application for the skin,
but young maidens while gathering it were careful not “to put foot
within the rings, lest they should be liable to the fairies’ power.”—(“Illustrations
of Shakspeare,” Francis Douce, London, 1807, vol. i.
p. 180.)</p>

<p>It would seem that the Saxons in England, at the time of the Norman
Conquest, were fully aware of the deadly effects producible by the
mushroom: “The old woman came back to her, ere she went to bed.
‘I have found it all out and more. I know where to get scarlet toadstools
and I put the juice in his men’s ale. They are laughing and
roaring now, merry-mad every one of them.’”</p>

<p>The effects of the potion are thus described: “His men were grouped
outside of the gate, chattering like monkeys; the porter and the monks
from the inside entreating them, vainly, to come in and go to bed
quietly.</p>

<p>“But they would not. They vowed and swore that a great gulf
had opened all down the road, and that one step more would tumble
them in headlong.... In vain Hereward stormed; assured them
that the supposed abyss was nothing but the gutter; proved the fact
by kicking Martin over it. The men determined to believe their own
eyes, and after a while fell asleep in heaps in the roadside, and lay
there till morning, when they woke, declaring, as did the monks, that
they had been bewitched. They knew not—and happily, the lower
orders, both in England and on the Continent, do not yet know—the
potent virtues of that strange fungus with which Lapps and Samoieds
have, it is said, practised wonders for centuries past.”—(“Hereward,
the last of the English,” Charles Kingsley, New York, 1866, p. 111.)</p>

<span class="smaller">A USE OF POISONOUS FUNGI QUITE PROBABLY EXISTED AMONG THE MEXICANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>That some such use of poisonous fungi as has been shown exists
among the tribes of Siberia was made by other nations, would be
difficult to prove in the absence of direct testimony, but many incidental
references are encountered which the reflective mind must
consider with care before rejecting them as absolutely irrelevant in this
connection. The Mexicans, as we learn from Sahagun, were not ignorant
of the mushroom, which is described as the basis of one of their
festivals. He says that they ate the nanacatl, a poisonous fungus
which intoxicated as much as wine; after eating it, they assembled in
a plain, where they danced and sang by night and by day to their
fullest desire. This was on the first day, because on the following day
they all wept bitterly, and they said that they were cleaning themselves
and washing their eyes and faces with their tears.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It is true that Sahagun does not describe any specially revolting
feature in this orgy, but it is equally patent that he is describing from
hearsay, and, probably, he was not allowed to know too much. In a
second reference to this fungus, which he now calls teo-nanacatl,
he alludes to the toxic properties, which coincide closely with those
of the mushrooms noted in Siberia and on the northwest coast of
America.</p>

<p>“There are some mushrooms in this country which are called teo-nanacatl.
They grow under the grass in the fields and plains; ...
they are hurtful to the throat and intoxicate; ... those who eat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
them see visions and feel flutterings in the heart; those who eat many
of them are excited to lust, and even so if they eat but few.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The proof is not at all conclusive that this intoxication was produced
as among the Siberian and Cape Flattery tribes; but it is very odd
that the Aztecs should eat mushrooms for the same purpose; that they
should hold their dance out in a plain and by night (that is, in a place
as remote as possible from Father Sahagun’s inspection). On the second
day, to trust Sahagun’s explanation, they would appear to have
bewailed their behavior on the first; although it should be remarked
here that ceremonial weeping has not been unknown to the American
aborigines, and may, in this case, have been induced by causes not
revealed to the stranger. Lastly, it is important to note that this
poisonous fungus was a violent excitant, a nervous irritant, and an
aphrodisiac.</p>

<p>Another early Spanish observer, also cited by Kingsborough, describes
them in these terms:—</p>

<p>“They had another kind of drunkenness, ... which was with small
fungi or mushrooms, ... which are eaten raw, and, on account of
being bitter, they drink after them or eat with them a little honey of
bees, and shortly after that they see a thousand visions, especially
snakes.</p>

<p>“They went raving mad, running about the streets in a wild state
(‘bestial embriaguez’). They called these fungi ‘teo-na-m-catl,’ a
word meaning ‘bread of the gods.’”</p>

<p>This author does not allude to any effect upon the kidneys.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>This account can be compared, word for word, with those previously
quoted from the Moqui Indian and from the descriptions of the Ur-Orgies
of the Siberians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>The list of quotations is not yet complete. Tezozomoc, also an
author of repute, relates that at the coronation of Montezuma the
Mexicans gave wild mushrooms to the strangers to eat; that the
strangers became drunk, and thereupon began to dance.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> All of which
is a terse description of a drunken orgy induced by poisonous mushrooms,
but not represented with the disgusting sequences which would
have served to establish a connection with urine dances.</p>

<p>Diego Duran also gives the particulars of the coronation of this Montezuma
(the second of the name and the one on the throne at the date
of the arrival of Cortés). He says that, after the usual human sacrifices
had been offered up in the temples, all went to eat raw mushrooms,
which caused them to lose their senses and affected them more than
if they had drunk much wine. So utterly beside themselves were they
that many of them killed themselves with their own hands, and by the
potency of those mushrooms they saw visions and had revelations of
the future, the devil speaking to them in their drunkenness.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Duran,
of course, is not describing what he <i>saw</i>. Doubtless, in that case, his
narrative would have been more animated and, possibly, more to our
purpose.</p>

<h3>A FORMER USE OF FUNGUS INDICATED IN THE MYTHS OF CEYLON,
AND IN THE LAWS OF THE BRAHMINS.</h3>

<p>On the west shore of the Pacific Ocean, aside from the orgies of the
Siberian Shamans, no instance is on record of the use of the mushroom,
or other fungus in religious rites in the present day.</p>

<p>A former use of it is indicated in the Cingalese myths, which teach
that “Chance produced a species of mushroom called mattika<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> or jessathon,
on which they lived for sixty-five thousand years; but being determined
to make an equal division of this, also, they lost it. Luckily
for them, another creeping plant [mistletoe?] called badrilata grew up,
on which they (the Brahmins) fed for thirty-five thousand years, but
which they lost for the same reason as the former ones.”—(“Asiatic
Researches,” Calcutta, 1807, vol. vii. p. 441.)</p>

<p>Among the Brahmins of the main land no such myth is related; but
an English writer says:</p>

<p>“The ancient Hindus held the fungus in such detestation that Yama,
a legislator, supposed now to be the judge of departed spirits, declares:
‘Those who eat mushrooms, whether springing from the ground or
growing on a tree, fully equal in guilt to the slayers of Brahmins and
the most despicable of all deadly sinners.’”—(“Asiatic Researches,”
Calcutta, 1795, vol. iv. p. 311.)</p>

<p>Dubois refers to the same subject. “The Brahmins,” he says,
“have also retrenched from their vegetable food, which is the great
fund of their subsistence, all roots which form a head or bulb in the
ground, such as onions,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and those also which assume the same shape
above ground, like mushrooms and some others.... Are we to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that they had discovered something unwholesome in the one
species and proscribed the other on account of its fetid smell? This I
cannot decide; all the information I have ever obtained from those
among those whom I have consulted on the reasons of their abstinence
from them being that it is customary to avoid such articles.”—(Abbé
Dubois, “People of India,” London, 1817, p. 117.)</p>

<p>This inhibition, under such dire penalties, can have but one meaning.
In primitive times the people of India must have been so addicted
to the debauchery induced by potions into the composition of
which entered poisonous fungi and mistletoe (the mushroom “growing
on a tree”), and the effects of such debauchery must have been found
so debasing and pernicious, that the priest-rulers were compelled to
employ the same maledictions which Moses proved of efficacy in withdrawing
the children of Israel from the worship of idols.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE ONION ADORED BY THE EGYPTIANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There are examples of the ideas surrounding onions, leeks, garlic,
and bulbous vegetables of different kinds, in many countries.</p>

<p>“The Egyptians likened the whole firmament to an onion with its
varied shells and radiations; and this, together with the aphrodisiacal
and fertilizing properties which this vegetable is almost universally
held to possess, rendered it sacred.”—(“Rivers of Life,” Forlong, London,
1883, vol. i. p. 474.)</p>

<p>“The species of onion which the Egyptians abhorred was the squill
or red squill, because consecrated to Typhon; the other kinds they ate
indiscriminately.”—(Fosbroke, “Cyclopædia of Antiquities,” London,
1843, vol. ii. p. 109, article “Onion.”)</p>

<p>“At Babylon, beside Memphis, they made an onion their god.”—(Reginald
Scot, “Discovery of Witchcraft,” London, 1651, p. 376.)</p>

<p>“Beans the Egyptians do not sow at all in their country; neither do
they eat those that happen to grow there, nor taste them when dressed.
The priests indeed abhor the sight of that pulse, accounting it impure.”—(Herodotus,
“Euterpe,” p. 36.)</p>

<p>Among the Romans, “the Flamen Dialis might not ride, or even
touch, beans or ivy.”—(“The Golden Bough,” James G. Frazer, M.A.,
London, 1890, vol. i. p. 117.)</p>

<p>Pliny mentions the medicinal use of certain bulbs, difficult of identification
in our day. “The bulb of Mægara acts as a strong aphrodisiac;”
others “aid delivery;” others were used “for the cure of the
sting of serpents.” The ancients used to give bulb-seeds “to persons
afflicted with madness, in drink.”—(Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. 20,
cap. 40.)</p>

<p>Martial has the following: “XXXIV. Bulbs. If your wife is old
and your members languid, bulbs can do no more for you than fill
your belly” (edition of London, 1871). A footnote to the above
says: “To what particular bulb provocative effects were attributed is
unknown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Acosta says of the Peruvians that before any of their great ceremonies,
“to prepare themselves, all the people fasted two days, during
which they did neyther company with their wives nor eate any meate
with salt or garlicke, nor drink any chica.”—(Acosta, “Historie of
the Indies,” edition of London, 1604, quoted by Lang, “Myth, Ritual,
and Religion,” London, 1887, vol. ii. p. 283.)</p>

<p>According to Avicenna, garlic was a provocative of the menses (vol. i.
p. 276 a 52).</p>

<p>When a priest of the state religion of China is about to offer a sacrifice
he must abstain from cohabitation with his wives and “from eating
onions, leeks, or garlic.”—(“Chinese Repository,” Canton, 1835,
vol. iii. p. 52.)</p>

<p>Juvenal says of the Egyptians: “It is an impious act to break with
the teeth a leek or an onion.”—(Satire XV., Rev. Lewis Evans’s
translation.)</p>

<p>By the Irish peasantry “garlic is planted in the thatch” to drive
away fairies and witches.—(“Medical Mythology of Ireland,” James
Mooney, American Philosophical Society, 1887.)</p>

<p>The Danes placed garlic in the cradle of the new-born child to avert
the maleficence of witches.—(See Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. ii.
p. 73, article “Groaning Cakes and Cheese.”)</p>

<p>In rustic England many good folk still believe that the house upon
which grows the leek will never be struck by lightning.—(See Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 317, article “Rural Charms.”)</p>

<p>Speaking of the Russian dissenters, known as the Raskol, Heard
says: “They carried their resistance into all the details of daily life;
as matters of conscience, they eschewed the use of tobacco, for ‘the
things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man’
(Mark vii. 15); of the potato, as being the fruit with which the serpent
tempted Eve.”—(“The Russian Church and Russian Dissent,” Albert
F. Heard, New York and London, 1887, p. 194.)</p>

<p>The quotation from the New Testament seems applicable to the subject
of urine dances, and the interdiction of the use of the potato may
mean more than appears on the surface.</p>

<p>Possibly, the intention in Russia was to wean the sectaries away
from the use of bulbs or fungi not to the liking of the more thoughtful
leaders of the new movement.</p>

<p>“From the earliest times garlic has been an article of diet.”—(Encyclopædia
Britannica, mentioning Israelites, Egyptians, Greeks, and
Romans.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>In the time of Shakspeare, “to smell of garlic was accounted a sign
of vulgarity.”—(Idem, referring to “Coriolanus,” iv. 6, and “Measure
for Measure,” iii. 2.)</p>

<p>“Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at
cross-roads as a supper for Hecate.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“According to Pliny, garlic and onions were invoked as deities by
the Egyptians at the taking of oaths. The inhabitants of Pelusium, in
Lower Egypt, who worshipped the onion, are said to have held both
it and garlic in aversion as food.”—(Encyc. Brit., article “Garlic.”)</p>

<p>Garlic is “fastened to the caps of children, suspended from the
sterns of vessels and from new houses, in the Levant, as, centuries ago,
it was hung over the door in the more civilized parts of Europe.”—(“Superstitions
of Scotland,” John Graham Dalyell, Edinburgh, 1834,
p. 219.)</p>

<p>“The onion was among the earliest cultivated vegetables, and in
Egypt was a sort of divinity.”—(American Encyclopædia, New York,
1881, article “Onion.”)</p>

<p>“A phallic importance seems to have attached to the onion. Burton,
in his ‘Anatomy of Melancholy,’ edition of 1660, p. 538, speaks of
‘cromnysmantia,’—a kind of divination with onions laid on the altar
at Christmas Eve, practised by girls to know when they shall be married
and how many husbands they shall have. This appears also to
have been a German custom.”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii.
pp. 356, 357.)</p>

<span class="smaller">SACRED INTOXICATION AND PHALLISM.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Two fundamental principles underlie the structure of primordial
religion,—Intoxication and Phallism. All perversion of the
cerebral functions, whether temporary estrangement or permanent
alienation, is classified as Obsession; and the pranks and gibberish
of the maniac or the idiot are solemnly treasured as outbursts of
inspiration.</p>

<p>Where such temporary exaltation can be produced by an herb, bulb,
liquid, or food, the knowledge of such excitant is kept as long as possible
from the laity; and even after the general diffusion of a more enlightened
intelligence has broadened the mental horizon of the devotee,
these narcotics and irritants are “sacred,” and the frenzies they induce
are “sacred” also.</p>

<p>If the drug in question, whatever it be, possess the additional recommendation
of acting upon the genito-urinary organs, and by arousing
the sexual energies appeals to the phallic element in the religious
nature, the apotheosis of the drug follows as a matter of course, no
matter under what expression or symbolism it may be veiled; and as
human nature feels the necessity of restraint upon the passions as well
as a stimulus thereof, it follows that there are to be noted many cases
in which a veneration is paid to plants and drugs which have just the
opposite effect,—that is to say that where an aphrodisiac is held
among the sacred essences or agents its counter or antagonist is held
in almost equal esteem.</p>

<p>Mushroom, mistletoe, rue, ivy, mandrake, hemp, opium, the stramonium
of the medicine-man of the Hualpai Indians of Arizona,—all
may well be examined in the light of this proposition. Frazer
says: “According to primitive notions, all abnormal states—such as
intoxication or madness—are caused by the entrance of a spirit
into the person; such mental states, in other words, are regarded as
forms of possession or inspiration.”—(“The Golden Bough,” vol. i.
p. 184.)</p>

the ivy and plucked it off, tearing it to pieces with their hands and
gnawing it with their mouths.... It was reported ... it hath a
spirit that stirreth and moveth to madness, transporting and bereaving
of the senses, and that alone by itself it introduceth drunkenness without
wine to those that have an easy inclination to enthusiasm.”—(Plutarch,
“Morals,” Goodwin’s English translation, Boston, 1870,
vol. ii. p. 264.)</p>

<p>An eternal drunkenness was the reward held out to the savage warrior
in many regions of the world; the Scandinavians, as well as the Indians
of the Pampas, had this belief.—(See “Les Primitifs,” Elie Réclus,
Paris, 1885, p. 123.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the Ur-Orgy of the Siberians, Dr. J. W. Kingsley comments
in the following terms: “I remember being shown this fungus
by an Englishman who was returning via the Central Pacific Railway
from Siberia. He fully confirmed all that I had heard on the subject,
having seen the orgy himself.... Nothing religious in this, you may
say; but look at the question a little closer and you will see that these
‘intoxicants,’ which nowadays are used to produce mere excitement
or brutal drunkenness, were at first looked upon as media able to raise
the mere man up to a level with his gods, and enable him to communicate
with them, as was certainly the case with the ‘soma’ of the Hindu
ecstatics and the hashich I have seen used by some tribes of Arabs.
It would be well worth while trying to ascertain whether the actors in
the Ur-Orgy had eaten any particular kind of herb before its commencement,
or whether they had any tradition of their ancestors having
done so.”—(Personal letter to Captain Bourke, dated Cambridge,
England, May, 1888.)</p>

Lenormant, p. 255, where there is a reference to “intoxicating
drugs.”</p>

<span class="smaller">AN INQUIRY INTO THE DRUIDICAL USE OF THE MISTLETOE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>But the question at once presents itself, For what reason did the
Celtic Druids employ the much venerated mistletoe? This
question becomes of deep significance in the light of the learning shed
by Godfrey Higgins and General Vallencey upon the derivation of the
Druids from Buddhistic or Brahminical origin.</p>

<p>“Ajasson enumerates the following superstitions of ancient Britain,
as bearing probable marks of an Oriental origin: ... the ceremonials
used in cutting the plants.”—(“Mistletoe,” Pliny, Bohn, lib. 30,
cap. 6, footnote.)</p>

<p>That the mistletoe was regarded as a medicine, and a very potent
one, is easy enough to show. All the encyclopædias admit that much;
but the accounts that have been preserved of the ideas associated with
this worship are not complete or satisfactory.</p>

<p>“The mistletoe, which they (the Druids) called ‘all-heal,’ used
to cure disease.”—(McClintock and Strong’s Encyclopædia, quoting
Stukeley.)</p>

<p>“The British bards and Druids had an extraordinary veneration for
the number three. ‘The mistletoe,’ says Vallencey, in his ‘Grammar
of the Irish Language,’ ‘was sacred to the Druids, because not only its
berries, but its leaves also, grow in clusters of three united to one
stock. The Christian Irish held the Seamroy sacred in like manner,
because of three leaves united to one stock.’”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,”
London, 1872, vol. i, p. 109, article “St. Patrick’s Day.”)</p>

<p>“Within recent times the mistletoe has been regarded as a valuable
remedy in epilepsy (query, on the principle of <i>similia similibus</i>?) and
other diseases, but at present is not employed.... The leaves have
been fed to sheep in time of scarcity of other forage (which shows at
least that it is edible).”—(Appleton’s American Encyclopædia.)</p>

<p>“Seems to possess no decided medical properties.”—(International
Encyclopædia.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“It is now perhaps impossible to account for the veneration in
which it was held and the wonderful qualities which it was supposed
to possess.”—(“The Druids,” Rev. Richard Smiddy, Dublin, 1871,
p. 90.)</p>

<p>Pliny mentions three varieties. Of these “the hyphar is useful for
fattening cattle, if they are hardy enough to withstand the purgative
effect it produces at first; the viscum is medicinally of value as an
emollient, and in cases of tumors, ulcers, and the like.”</p>

<p>Pliny is also quoted as saying that it was considered of benefit to
women in childbirth,—“in conceptum feminarum adjuvare si omnino
secum habeant.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Pliny is also authority for the reverence in which
the mistletoe growing on the robur (Spanish <i>roble</i>, or evergreen oak)
was held by the Druids. The robur, he says, is their sacred tree,
and whatever is found growing upon it, they regard as sent from
heaven and as the mark of a tree chosen by God.—(Encyclopædia
Britannica.)</p>

<p>Brand (“Popular Antiquities,” London, 1849, vol. i. article “Mistletoe”)
cites the opinion of various old authors that mistletoe was regarded
“as a medicine very likely to subdue not only the epilepsy,
but all other convulsive disorders.... The high veneration in which
the Druids were held by the people of all ranks proceeded in a great
measure from the wonderful cures they wrought by means of the mistletoe
of the oak.... The mistletoe of the oak, which is very rare, is
vulgarly said to be a cure for wind-ruptures in children; the kind
which is found upon the apple is said to be good for fits.”</p>

<p>“The Persians and Masagetæ thought the mistletoe something
divine, as well as the Druids.”—(“Antiquities of Cornwall,” 1796,
p. 63.)</p>

<p>After telling of the use of this plant among the Druids and their
mode of gathering it, Fosbroke adds: “Mistletoe was not unknown in
the religious ceremonies of the ancients, and was supposed to have
magical and medicinal properties.”—(Fosbroke, Cyclopædia of Antiquities,
vol. ii. p. 1047, article “Mistletoe,” London, 1843.)</p>

<p>Mr. W. Winwood Reade mentions, in his “Veil of Isis” (London,
1861), at page 69, that the missolding or mistletoe of the oak, still
called in Wales “all-iach,” or “all-heal,” was the sovereign remedy of
the Druids; and at page 71 he adds that a powder from its berries was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
considered a cure for sterility. He describes the effect of mistletoe
as that of a strong purgative.—(Personal letter from Frank Rede
Fowke, Esq., South Kensington Museum, London, England, June 18,
1888.)</p>

<p>“The Druids named it Uil-loc or All-Heal, because they said it promoted
increase of species or prevented sterility.”—(“Rivers of Life,”
Forlong, vol. ii. p. 331.)</p>

<p>“We shall probably never hear the whole truth in regard to this ancient
religion (Druidism); for, as Mr. Davies says, ‘most of the offensive
ceremonies must have been either retrenched or concealed,’ as the
Roman laws and edicts had for ages (before the Bardic writings) restrained
the more cruel and bloody sacrifices, and at the time of the
Bards nothing remained but symbolic rites.”—(“Rivers of Life,”
Forlong, vol. ii. p. 331.)</p>

<p>The plant (mistletoe) is one of world-wide fame. Masagetæ, Skythians,
and the most ancient Persians called it the “Healer,” and Virgil
calls it a “branch of gold;” while Charon was dumb in presence of
such an augur of coming bliss; it was “the expectancy of all nations,
longe post tempore visum, as betokening Sol’s return to earth.”—(“Rivers
of Life,” Forlong, vol. i. p. 81.)</p>

<p>Borlase sees much similarity between the Magi and our Druids, and
Strabo did the same. “Both carried in their hands, during the celebration
of their rites, a bunch of plants; that of the Magi was of course
the Hom, called Barsom,—Assyrian and Persepolis sculptures substantiate
this. The Hom looks very much like the Mistletoe, and the
learned Dr. Stukeley thinks that this parasite is meant as being on
the tree mentioned by Isaiah, vi. 13.”—(“Rivers of Life,” Forlong,
vol. i. p. 43.)</p>

<p>“But yet it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and shall be eaten;
as a teil tree and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they
cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.”—(Isaiah,
vi. 13.)</p>

<p>“The mistletoe wreath marks in one sense Venus’s temple, for any
girl may be kissed if caught under its sprays,—a practice, though
modified, which recalls to us that horrid one mentioned by Herodotus,
where all women were for once at least the property of the man who
sought them in Mylitta’s temple.”—(“Rivers of Life,” Forlong, London,
1883, vol. i. p. 91.)</p>

<p>The following are Frazer’s views on this subject: “The mistletoe
was viewed as the seat of life of the oak. The conception of the mistletoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
as the seat of life of the oak would naturally be suggested to primitive
people by the observation that while the oak is deciduous, the
mistletoe which grows on it is evergreen. In winter, the sight of its
fresh foliage among the bare branches must have been hailed by the
worshippers of the tree as a sign that the divine life which had ceased
to animate the branches yet survived in the mistletoe, as the heart of
the sleeper still beats when his body is motionless. Hence, when the
god had to be killed, when the sacred tree had to be burnt, it was
necessary to begin by breaking off the mistletoe, for so long as the
mistletoe remained intact, the oak (so people thought) was invulnerable,—all
the blows of their knives and axes would glance harmless
from its surface. But once tear from the oak its sacred heart, the
mistletoe, and the tree nodded to its fall.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
James G. Frazer, M. A., London, 1890, vol. ii. pp. 295, 296.)</p>

<p>This train of reasoning would be irrefutable, as it is most logical,
were we in a position to be able to say that the excision of the fungus
was followed by the felling of the tree; but, unfortunately, that is
just what we are not able to determine. As a surmise, there is no
impropriety in believing that such excision may have marked the oak
for destruction at some future day; but there is no authority that we
can produce at this time to justify anything more than a surmise in
the premises. That the sacred character of the oak was due to the
properties discovered in the mistletoe is quite likely in view of all the
facts already presented.</p>

<p>O’Curry, who appears to have known all that was to be learned on
the subject of Druidism, admits that the world is in possession of very
little that is reliable; he inclines to the view that Druidism was of
Eastern origin. (See “Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish,”
Eugene O’Curry, London, Edinburgh, Dublin, and New York, 1873.)
He contends that “the Sacred Wand” of the Druids was made of the
yew, and not of the oak or mistletoe.—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 194.)</p>

<p>Vallencey did not believe that the Persians were acquainted with
the mistletoe; at least, he could not find any name for it in Persian.—(See
Major Charles Vallencey, “Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis,”
Dublin, 1774, vol. ii. p. 433.)</p>

<p>“In Cambodia, when a man perceives a certain parasitic plant growing
on a tamarind-tree, he dresses in white and taking a new earthen
pot climbs the tree at mid-day. He puts the plant in the pot and lets
the whole fall to the ground. Then in the pot he makes a decoction
which renders him invulnerable.”—(Aymonier, “Notes sur les Coûtumes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
etc., des Cambodgiens,” quoted in “The Golden Bough,” vol. ii.
p. 286, footnote.)</p>

<p>“It was that only which is found upon the oak which the Druids
employed; and being a parasitic plant, the seeds of which are not sown
by the hand of man, it was well adapted for the purposes of superstition.”—(“Philosophy
of Magic,” Salverte, vol. i. p. 229.)</p>

<p>Much testimony may be adduced to show that the mistletoe was
valued as an aphrodisiac, as conducive to fertility, as sacred to love,
and, in general terms, an excitant of the genito-urinary organs, which
is the very purpose for which the Siberian and North American medicine-men
employed the fungus, and perhaps the very reason for which
both fungus and mistletoe were excluded from the Brahminical
dietary.</p>

<p>Brand shows that mistletoe “was not unknown in the religious
ceremonies of the ancients, particularly the Greeks,” and that the use
of it, savoring strongly of Druidism, prevailed at the Christmas service
of York Cathedral down to our own day.—(See in Brand, “Popular
Antiquities,” London, 1849, vol. i. p. 524.)</p>

<p>The merry pastime of kissing pretty girls under the Christmas
mistletoe seems to have a phallic derivation. “This very old custom
has descended from feudal times, but its real origin and significance
are lost.” (“Appleton’s American Encyclopædia.”) Brand shows that
the young men observed the custom of “plucking off a berry at each
kiss.” (Vol. i. p. 524.) Perhaps, in former times, they were required
to swallow the berry. The deductions of a recent writer merit
attention:—</p>

<p>“The mistletoe was dedicated to Mylitta, in whose worship every
woman must once in her life submit to the sexual embrace of a stranger.
When she concluded to perform this religious duty in honor of her
acknowledged deity, she repaired to the temple and placed herself
under the mistletoe, thus offering herself to the first stranger who
solicited her favors. The modern modification of the ceremony is found
in the practice among some people of hanging the mistletoe, at certain
seasons of the year, in the parlor or over the door, when the woman
entering that door, or found standing under the wreath, must kiss the
first man who approaches her and solicits the privilege.” (“Phallic
Worship,” Robert Allen Campbell, C. E., St. Louis, Mo., 1888, p. 202.)</p>

<p>A writer in “Notes and Queries” (Jan. 3, 1852, vol. v. p. 13) quotes
Nares to the effect that “the maid who was not kissed under it at
Christmas would not be married in that year.” But another writer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
(Feb. 28, 1852, same volume) points out that “we should refer the
custom to the Scandinavian mythology, wherein the mistletoe is dedicated
to Friga, the Venus of the Scandinavians.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Grimm speaks of Paltar (Balder) being killed by the stroke of a
piece of mistletine, but ventures upon no explanation.—(“Teutonic
Mythology,” vol. i. p. 220, article “Paltar.”)</p>

<p>“Within the sanctuary at Nemi grew a certain tree of which no
branch might be broken. Only a runaway slave was allowed to
break off, if he could, one of its boughs. Success in the attempt entitled
him to fight the priest in single combat, and if he slew him he
reigned in his stead with the title of King of the Wood (Rex Nemorensis.)
Tradition averred that the fatal branch was that ‘golden bough’
which at the Sibyl’s bidding, Æneas plucked before he essayed the
perilous journey to the world of the dead.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, vol. i. p. 4, article “The Arician Grove.”)</p>

<p>“A plant associated with the death of one of their greatest and
best-beloved gods must have been supremely sacred to all of Teutonic
blood; and yet this opinion of its sacredness was shared by the Celtic
nations.” (Grimm, “Teutonic Mythology,” vol. iii. p. 1205.) “Our
herbals divide mistletoe into those of the oak, hazel, and pear tree;
and none of them must be let touch the ground.”—(Idem, p. 1207.)</p>

<p>Another writer (“Notes and Queries,” 2d series, vol. iv. p. 506) says:
“As it was supposed to possess the mystic power of giving fertility and
a power to preserve from poison, the pleasant ceremony of kissing under
the mistletoe may have some reference to this belief.”</p>

<p>In vol. iii. p. 343, it is stated: “A Worcestershire farmer was accustomed
to take down his bough of mistletoe and give it to the cow that
calved first after New Year’s Day. This was supposed to insure
good luck to the whole dairy. Cows, it may be remarked, as well as
sheep, will devour mistletoe with avidity.”</p>

<p>And still another (in 2d series, vol. vi. p. 523) recognizes that “the
mistletoe was sacred to the heathen Goddess of Beauty,” and “it is certain
that the mistletoe, though it formerly had a place among the
evergreens employed in the Christian decorations, was subsequently
excluded.” This exclusion he accounts for thus: “It is also certain
that, in the earlier ages of the church, many festivities not at all tending
to edification (the practice of mutual kissing among the rest) had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
gradually crept in and established themselves, so that, at a certain
part of the service, ‘statim clerus, ipseque populus per basia blande
sese invicim oscularetur.’”</p>

<p>This author cites Hone, Hook, Moroni, Bescherelle, Ducange, and
others. Finally (in the 3d series, vol. vii. p. 76), an inquirer asks, “How
came it in Shakspeare’s time to be considered ‘baleful,’ and, in our
days, the most mirth-provoking of plants?” And still another correspondent,
in the same series (vol. vii. p. 237), claims that “mistletoe
will produce abortion in the female of the deer or dog.”</p>

<p>“Sir John Ollbach, in his dissertation concerning mistletoe, which he
strongly recommends as a medicine very likely to subdue not only the
epilepsy, but all other convulsive disorders, observes that this beautiful
plant must have been designed by the Almighty for other and more
noble purposes than barely to feed thrushes or to be hung up superstitiously
in houses to drive away evil spirits. He tells (p. 12) that
‘the high veneration in which the Druids were anciently held by the
people of all ranks proceeded in a great measure from the wonderful
cures they wrought by means of the mistletoe of the oak; this tree
being sacred to them, but none so that had not the mistletoe upon
them.’ Mr. F. Williams, dating from Pembroke, Jan. 28, 1791, tells
us, in the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine’ for February that year, that
‘“Guidhel,” mistletoe, a magical shrub, appeared to be the forbidden
tree in the middle of the trees of Eden; for, in the Edda, the mistletoe
is said to be Balder’s death, who yet perished through blindness
and a woman.’”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872,
vol. i. p. 519, article “Evergreen-decking at Christmas.”)</p>

<h3>FORMER EMPLOYMENT OF AN INFUSION OR DECOCTION OF MISTLETOE.</h3>

<p>That an infusion or decoction of the plant was once in use may be
gathered from the fact narrated by John Eliot Howard: “Water, in
which the sacred mistletoe had been immersed, was given to or sprinkled
upon the people.”—(“The Druids and their Religion,” John Eliot
Howard, in “Transactions of Victoria Institute,” vol. xiv. p. 118, quoting
“Le gui de chêne et les Druides,” E. Magdaleine, Paris, 1877.)</p>

<p>Montfaucon says of the Druids: “Ils croient que les animaux
stériles deviennent féconds en buvant de l’eau de gui.”—(“L’antiquité
Expliquée, Paris, 1722, tome 2, part 2, p. 436, quoting and translating
Pliny.)</p>

<p>“The misselto, or ‘Uil-ice,’ was required to be taken, if possible,
from the Jovine tree when in its prime; but it was rare to find it on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
any oak. If obtained from one about thirty-five years old, and taken
in a potion, it conferred fertility on men, women, and children.”—(“Rivers
of Life,” Forlong, vol. ii. p. 355.)</p>

<p>Eugene O’Curry speaks of the Irish Druids having a “drink of oblivion,”
the composition of which has not, however, come down to us.
(See “Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish,” vol. ii. p. 198.)
O’Curry calls this drink of oblivion a “Druidical charm,” and a “Druidical
incantation.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 226.)<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>See notes in this monograph on the Hindu Lingam.</p>

<h3>THE MISTLETOE ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN HELD SACRED BY THE
MOUND-BUILDERS.</h3>

<p>An American writer says that among the Mound-builders the mistletoe
was “the holiest and most rare of evergreens,” and that when
human sacrifices were offered to sun and moon the victim was covered
with mistletoe, which was burnt as an incense. (Pidgeon, “Dee-coo-dah,”
New York, 1853, p. 91 <i>et seq.</i>) Pidgeon claimed to receive his
knowledge from Indians versed in the traditions and lore of their
tribes.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Eastman presents a drawing of what may be taken as the altar
of Haokah, the anti-natural god of the Sioux, in which is a representation
of a “large fungus that grows on trees” (query, mistletoe?),
which, if eaten by an animal, will cause its death.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h3>THE MISTLETOE FESTIVAL OF THE MEXICANS.</h3>

<p>That the Mexicans had a reverence for the mistletoe would seem to
be assured. They had a mistletoe festival. In October they celebrated
the festival of the Neypachtly, or bad eye, which was a plant
growing on trees and hanging from them, gray with the dampness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
rain; especially did it grow on the different kinds of oak.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The informant
says he can give no explanation of this festival.</p>

<h3>VESTIGES OF DRUIDICAL RITES AT THE PRESENT DAY.</h3>

<p>It may be interesting to detect vestiges of Druidical rites tenaciously
adhering to the altered life of modern civilization.</p>

<p>In the department of Seine-et-Oise, twelve leagues from Paris (says
a recent writer), when a child had a rupture (hernia) he was brought
under a certain oak, and some women, who no doubt earned a living
in that trade, danced around the oak, muttering spell-words till the
child was cured,—that is, dead.—(“Notes and Queries,” 5th series,
vol. vii. p. 163.)</p>

<p>It has already been shown that the Druids ascribed this very medical
quality to the mistletoe of the oak.</p>

<p>“In Brittany a festival for the mistletoe is still kept.... The
people there call it ‘touzon ar gros,’—‘the herb of the cross.’”—(“Commonplace
Book,” Buckle, vol. ii. of his Works, p. 440, London,
1872.)</p>

<p>Mistletoe has been burned in England in love divinations.—(See
Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London, 1872, vol. iii. p. 358, article
“Divination by Flowers.”)</p>

<p>Frommann enumerates mistletoe among “Recentiorum ad fascinum
remedia.... Viscum corylinum et tiliaceum” (hazel or filbert and
linden trees). The genitalia of the bewitched person were anointed
with an ointment prepared from the hazel mistletoe to untie “ligatures.”
(See Frommann, “Tractatus de Fascinatione,” Nuremberg,
1675, pp. 938, 957, 958, 965.)</p>

<p>“We find that persons in Sweden who are afflicted with the falling
sickness carry with them a knife having a handle of oak mistletoe, to
ward off attacks. A piece of mistletoe hung round the neck would
ward off other sicknesses. We have Culpepper’s authority for saying
‘it is excellent good for the grief of the sinew, itch, sores, and
tooth-ache, the biting of mad dogs, and venemous beasts, and that it
purgeth choler very gently.’ Grimm notes that it was with a branch
of mistletoe that Balder was killed.... The Kadeir Taliasin says that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the mistletoe was one of the ingredients in the <i>awen a gwybodeu</i>, or
water of inspiration, science, and immortality, which the goddess Kod
prepared in her cauldron. Witches were thought to have no power to
hurt those who bore mistletoe round their neck. Sir Thomas Browne
speaks of the virtues of mistletoe in cases of epilepsy.”—(“Folk-Medicine,”
Black, London, 1883, p. 196.)</p>

<p>The same belief in Waters of Life, science, immortality, etc., seems
to obtain among the Slav nations, who also speak in their myths of
“the crazy weed,” which may, perhaps, be classified with the weed of
the Borgie well, which, as we have seen, “set a’ the Camerslang fo’k
wrang i’ th’ head.”—(See “Myths and Folk-Tales of the Russians,
Western Slavs, and Magyars,” Jeremiah Curtin, Boston, Mass., 1890.)</p>

<p>The mistletoe, especially that from the linden and the oak, was enumerated
by Etmuller among the cures for epilepsy (“tiliaceum et
quercinum”); others recommended that from the elder or willow.
For the same disease, on the same page, “zibethum” was prescribed.
(See Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” Lyons, 1690, vol. i. p. 198: “Comment.
Ludovic.”)</p>

<p>The mistletoe of the juniper, gathered in the month of May, was
good for eye-water. “Maio mense instar musci adnascitur inservit
aquæ ophthalmicæ.”—(Etmuller, vol. i. p. 84, “Schroderi Dilucidati
Phytologia.”)</p>

<p>Fungi of different kinds dried were used as styptics.—(Idem, p. 70.)</p>

<p>The fungus of the oak was especially good for this purpose.—(Idem,
p. 127.)</p>

<p>The mistletoe of the oak was regarded as of special value in all
uterine troubles, hemorrhages, suppression of the menses, etc.—(Idem,
p. 127.)</p>

<p>In the Myth of Kale-wala a young maiden is represented as becoming
pregnant by eating a berry. (See “Myth, Ritual, and Religion,”
Andrew Lang, London, 1887, vol. ii. p. 179.)</p>

<p>We may ask the question, what kind of a berry this was. Reference
may also be had to what Lang has to say on the mythical conceptions
alleged to have been induced by juniper and other berries.—(Idem,
p. 180.)</p>

<p>The “mistletoe of the oake” was administered internally against
“epilepsie.”—(“Most Excellent and Most Approved Remedies,” London,
1654, p. 14.)</p>

Black, p. 173.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>In Murrayshire, Scotland, “at the full moon in March, the inhabitants
cut withies of the mistletoe or ivy, make circles of them, keep them all
the year, and pretend to cure hectics and other troubles with them.”—(Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 151, article “Moon.”)</p>

<p>“In North Germany, where the old Teutonic cult still lingers, the
villagers run about on Christmas, striking the doors and windows
with hammers, and shouting, ‘Guthyl! Guthyl!’—plainly the Druidical
name for mistletoe used by Pliny. In Holstein, the people call the
mistletoe ‘the branch of spectres;’ ... they think it cures fresh
wounds and ensures success in hunting.” Stukeley is quoted to show
that the veneration for the plant prevailed at the Cathedral of York
down to the most recent times.—(Encyclopædia Metropolitana.)</p>

<p>“Misseltoe of the oake drunk cureth certainly this disease” (epilepsy).—(“The
Poor Man’s Physician,” John Moncrief, Edinburgh,
1716, p. 71.)</p>

<p>Still another writer reckons it a specific in epilepsy; also in apoplexy,
vertigo, to prevent convulsions, and to assist children in teething,
being worn round their necks. “We have accounts of strange
superstitious customs used in gathering it, and that if they are not
complied with it loses its virtue. This is by some conjectured to be
the golden bough which Æneas made use of to introduce him to the
Elysian regions, as is beautifully described in Virgil’s sixth Æneid.”—(“Complete
English Dispensatory,” John Quincy, M.D., London,
1730, p. 134.)</p>

<p>Culpepper wrote that the mistletoe, especially that growing upon
the oak, was beneficial in the falling sickness, in apoplexy, and in
palsy; also as a preventive of witchcraft; in the last-named case it
should be worn about the neck. He did not seem to know anything
of the origin of these ideas and practices.—(See Richard Culpepper,
“The English Physician,” London, 1765, p. 217.)</p>

<p>Pomet, in his “History of Drugs,” London, 1737, describes agaric
as an excrescence “found on the larch, oak, etc.... The best agaric
is that from the Levant;” only that “which the antients used to call
the female should be used in medicine.” It was prescribed in “all
distempers proceeding from gross humors and obstructions,”—such as
epilepsy, vertigo, mania, etc.; and this partly on the sympathetic or
<i>similia similibus</i> principle.</p>

<p>In one of the preparations for epilepsy, said by Beckherius to have
been recommended by Galen, occurs “Agaricus Viscus Querci.”—(See
Danielus Beckherius, “Medicus Microcosmus,” London, 1660, p. 208.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“When found growing on the oak, the mistletoe represented man.”—(Opinion
of the French writer Reynaud, in his article “Druidism,”
quoted in the Encyclopædia Britannica.)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this abundant proof, which might, if necessary, be
swollen in volume, of the survival in domestic medicine, as well as in
medical practice of a more pretentious character, of the use of the
mistletoe, more particularly in cases of epilepsy, there is no instance of
its employment noticed in “Saxon Leechdoms.”</p>

<p>The explanation may be found in the fact that that compilation was
rather exponential of the knowledge still possessed by the monks of
classical therapeutics than of the skill attained by the Saxons themselves;
there are pages of quotations from Sextus Placitus and other
authorities, but scarcely anything to show that the ideas of the Saxons
themselves were represented.</p>

<h3>THE LINGUISTICS OF THE MISTLETOE.</h3>

<p>Other curious instances of survival present themselves in the linguistics
of the subject. The French word “gui,” meaning mistletoe,
is not of Latin, but of Druidical derivation, and so the Spanish “aguinaldo,”
meaning Christmas or New Year’s present, conserves the cry,
slightly altered, of the Druid priest to the “gui” at the opening of
the new year.</p>

<p>“Aguillanneuf, et plus clairement, ‘au gui, l’an neuf,’ ou bien
encore, ‘l’anguil l’an neuf.’”—(Le Roux de Lincy, Livre des Proverbes
Français, 1848, Paris, tome 1, p. 2, quoted in Buckle’s “Commonplace
Book,” vol. ii. p. 440.)</p>

<p>“The next business was to arrange for the collection of the sacred
plant, and bards were sent forth in all directions to summon the
people to the great religious ceremony. The words of the proclamation
are believed to survive in the custom which prevails, especially at
Chartres, the old metropolis of the Druids, of soliciting presents on the
New Year, with the words ‘au gui l’an neuf.’”—(“Le Gui de Chêne
et les Druides,” Magdaleine, quoted by John Elliot Howard, in
“Victoria Society Transactions,” vol. xiv.)</p>

<p>“The Celtic name for the oak was ‘gue,’ or ‘guy.’”—(Brand, Pop.
Ant., vol. i. p. 458.)</p>

<p>A writer in “Notes and Queries” shows (vol. ii. p. 163) that the
word mistletoe is “le gui” in French; the continental Druid was
called Gui, or a Guy, from “cuidare,” whence “Guide.” At the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
present day, while the mistletoe itself is a charm, the name is a term
of opprobrium,—guy, in English.</p>

<p>M. C. H. Gaidoz takes exception to this interpretation. In his
opinion, the words “aguinaldo” and “à gui l’an neuf” are to be derived
from the Latin “ad calendas.”—(Personal letter, dated Paris,
France, March 11, 1889.)</p>

<span class="smaller">COW DUNG AND COW URINE IN RELIGION.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The sacrificial value of cow dung and cow urine throughout India
and Thibet is much greater than the reader might be led to infer
from the brief citation already noted from Max Müller.</p>

<p>“Hindu merchants in Bokhara now lament loudly at the sight of a
piece of cow’s flesh, and at the same time mix with their food, that it
may do them good, the urine of a sacred cow, kept in that place.”—(Erman,
“Siberia,” London, 1848, vol. i. p. 384.)</p>

<p>Picart narrates that the Brahmins fed grain to a sacred cow, and
afterward searched in the ordure for the sacred grains, which they
picked out whole, drying and administering them to the sick, not
merely as a medicine, but as a sacred thing.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Not only among the people of the lowlands, but among those of
the foot-hills of the Himalayas as well, do these rites find place; “the
very dung of the cow is eaten as an atonement for sin, and its urine is
used in worship.”—(Notes on the Hill Tribes of the Neilgherries,
Short, Trans. Ethnol. Society, London, 1868, p. 268.)</p>

<p>“The greatest, or, at any rate, the most convenient of all purifiers
is the urine of a cow; ... Images are sprinkled with it. No man
of any pretensions to piety or cleanliness would pass a cow in the
act of staling without receiving the holy stream in his hand and sipping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
a few drops.... If the animal be retentive, a pious expectant
will impatiently apply his finger, and by judicious tickling excite the
grateful flow.”—(Moor’s “Hindu Pantheon,” London, 1810, p. 143.)</p>

<p>See, also, note from Forlong, under “Initiation,” p. 164.</p>

<p>“It may be noted that, according to Lajarde, ‘cow’s-water’ originally
meant rain-water, the clouds being spoken of as cows. I give
this for what it is worth. Your collection of facts goes strongly against
the explanation.”—(Personal letter from Prof. W. Robertson Smith,
dated Christ College, Cambridge, England, August 11, 1888.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the sacrifice called Poojah, Maurice says: “The Brahman
prepares a place, which is purified with dried cow-dung, with
which the pavement is spread, and the room is sprinkled with the
urine of the same animal.”—(Maurice, “Indian Antiquities,” London,
1800, vol. i. p. 77.)</p>

<p>“As in India, so in Persia, the urine of the cow is used in ceremonies
of purification, during which it is drunk.”—(“Zoölogical Mythology,”
Angelo de Gubernatis, London, 1872, vol. i. p. 95, quoting
from Anquétil du Pérron, “Zendavesta,” ii. p. 245.)</p>

<p>Dubois, in his chapter “Restoration to the Caste,” says that a
Hindu penitent “must drink the <i>panchakaryam</i>,—a word which literally
signifies the five things, namely, milk, butter, curd, dung, and
urine, all mixed together.” And he adds:—</p>

<p>“The urine of the cow is held to be the most efficacious of any for
purifying all imaginable uncleanness. I have often seen the superstitious
Hindu accompanying these animals when in the pasture, and
watching the moment for receiving the urine as it fell, in vessels which
he had brought for the purpose, to carry it home in a fresh state; or,
catching it in the hollow of his hand, to bedew his face and all his
body. When so used it removes all external impurity, and when
taken internally, which is very common, it cleanses all within.”—(Abbé
Dubois, “People of India,” London, 1817, p. 29.)</p>

<p>Very frequently the excrement is first reduced to ashes. The monks
of Chivem, called Pandarones, smear their faces, breasts, and arms with
the ashes of cow dung; they run through the streets demanding alms,
very much as the Zuñi actors demanded a feast, and chant the praises
of Chivem, while they carry a bundle of peacock feathers in the hand,
and wear the <i>lingam</i> at the neck.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<h3>COW DUNG ALSO USED BY THE ISRAELITES.</h3>

<p>“The tribes had not many feelings in common when they came to be
writers and told us what they thought of each other. As a rule, they
bitterly reviled each other’s gods and temples.... Judeans called
the Samaritan temple, where calves and bulls were holy, in a word of
Greek derivation, ‘Pelethos Naos,’ ‘the dung-hill temple.’ ... The
Samaritans, in return, called the temple of Jerusalem ‘the house of
dung.’”—(“Rivers of Life,” Forlong, vol. i. p. 162.)</p>

<p>Commentators would be justified in believing that these terms preserve
the fact of there having been in these places of worship the
same veneration for dung that is to be found to this day among the
peoples of the East Indies.</p>

<p>In another place Dulaure calls attention to the similar use among
the Hebrews of the ashes of the dung of the red heifer as an expiatory
sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In one of the Hindu fasts the devotee adopts these disgusting excreta
as his food. On the fourth day, “his disgusting beverage is the
urine of the cow; the fifth, the excrement of that holy animal is his
allotted food.”—(Maurice, “Indian Antiquities,” London, 1800, vol. v.
p. 222.)</p>

<p>“I do not think that you can lay weight on the fact that in Israel,
when a victim was entirely burned, the dung was not exempted
from the fire. I think this only means that the victim was not cleared
of offal, as in sacrifices that were eaten.”—(Personal letter from Prof.
W. Robertson Smith, Christ College, Cambridge, England.)</p>

<p>“Refert etiam Waltherus Schulzius (“Oest-Indianische Reise,” lib. 3,
cap. 10, 1, m. 188, seq.) certam Indorum sectam Gioghi dictam nullum
assumere cibum, nisi fimo vaccino coctum; capillos et faciem Croco et
Stercore vaccino inungunt; nemo etiam in hanc societatem admittitur
nisi antea per longum temporis spatium Corpus suum hoc stercore
nutriverit, etc.”—(Schurig, “Chylologia,” p. 783, quoted in “Bibliotheca
Scatalogica,” pp. 93-96.)</p>

<p>Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” Commentar. Ludovic., Lyons, 1690, vol.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
ii. pp. 171, 172, says that the Benjani, an Oriental sect, believers in the
Transmigration of Souls, save the dung of their cows, gathering it up
in their hands.</p>

<p>Rosinus Lentilius, in the “Ephemeridum Physico-Medicorum,” Leipsig,
1694, quotes from the Itinerary of Tavernier, lib. 1, cap. 18, in
regard to the Scybolophagi Indorum, who, in pursuance of vows to
eat flesh only, scrape up the droppings of horses, bulls, cows, and
sheep. “Scybolophagi Indorum, de qua Tavernier, quod Benjanæ
aliæque mulieres voto semet obstringant soli manducationi quisquiliarum,
quas in pecorum, equorum, boum, vaccarum, stercoribus ruspatione
sedula conquirunt.... Nec proprie de Homerda seu humanis
excrementis, quibus Indorum nonnulli cibos condire, iisque ptarmici
pulvere vice uti, quin et medicamentis, ceu panaceam, commiscere,
non aversuntur.”</p>

<p>No mention is made by Marco Polo of the use by the people of India
of cow-dung or urine in any of their religious ceremonies, excepting one
example cited under the head of “Industries.” But the antiquity of
the rite is demonstrated by the fact that it is frequently alluded to
in the oldest of the canonical books of the people of India.</p>

<p>“Regarding the installation of Yudhisthira (the oldest son of Pandu
and eldest brother of the Pandavas), who became Maharajah after the
defeat and death of the Kauravas on the field of Kuruk-shetra, the Brahminical
authors of the Maha-Bharata, in its present form, describe
among the ceremonies used on the occasion the following one:” (Condensed
from the text of J. Talboys Wheeler, “History of India,”
“The Vedic Period and the Maha-Bharata,” vol. i. p. 371.) “After this,
the five purifying articles which are produced from the sacred cow—namely,
milk, the curds, ghee, the urine, and the ordure—were brought
up by Krishna and the Maharaja and by the brothers of Yudhisthira,
and poured by them over the heads of Yudhisthira and Draupadi.”</p>

<p>“The appearance of Krishna here stamps the narrative with the
characteristic cultus of a period far later than that in which the Vedic
Aryans had used the cow as a religious symbol. The animal was now
sacred to Vishnu, who held no place in the Vedic Pantheon, and his
worship had been sufficiently developed to admit of his incarnation as
Krishna.”—(Personal letter from Dr. J. Hampden Porter, dated
Washington, D. C., Sept. 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>De Gubernatis speaks of “the superstitious Hindoo custom of purifying
one’s self by means of the excrement of a cow. The same custom
passed into Persia; and the Kharda Avesta has preserved the formula<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
to be recited by the devotee while he holds in his hand the urine of an
ox or cow, preparatory to washing his face with it: ‘Destroyed, destroyed,
be the Demon Ahriman, whose actions and works are cursed.’”—(“Zoölogical
Mythology,” De Gubernatis, pp. 99-100, vol. i.)</p>

<p>“We must complete the explanation of another myth, that of the
excrement of the cow considered as purifying. The moon, as aurora,
yields ambrosia. It is considered to be a cow; the urine of this cow
is ambrosia or holy water; he who drinks this water purifies himself,
as the ambrosia which rains from the lunar ray and the aurora purifies
and makes clear the path of the sky, which the shadows of night darken
and contaminate.</p>

<p>“The same virtue is attributed, moreover, to cow’s dung, a conception
also derived from the cow, and given to the moon as well as to
the morning aurora. These two cows are considered as making the
earth fruitful by means of their ambrosial excrements; these excrements
being also luminous, both those of the moon and those of the
aurora are considered as purifiers. The ashes of these cows which
their friend the heroine preserves are not ashes, but golden powder or
golden flour (the golden cake again occurs in that flour or powder of
gold which the witch demands from the hero in Russian stories) which,
mixed with excrement, brings good fortune to the cunning robber-hero.</p>

<p>“The ashes of the sacrificed, pregnant cow (i. e., the cow which dies
after having given birth to a calf) were religiously preserved by the
Romans in the Temple of Vesta with bean-stalks, which are used to
fatten the earth sown with corn, as a means of expiation. Ovid mentions
this rite. (Fasti, iv. 721.) The ashes of a cow are preserved
both as a symbol of resurrection and as a means of purification.”—(“Zoöl.
Mythol.,” De Gubernatis, vol. i. pp. 275-277.)</p>

<p>The learned author overlooks in his argument that cows were sacrificed
and worshipped in India before they were transferred to the
Zodiac and to the symbolism of the elements.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Religion, at its base, is the product of imagination working on
early man’s wants and fears, and is in no sense supernatural or the
result of any preconceived and deliberate thought or desire to work
out a system of morals. It arose in each case from what appeared to
be the pressing needs of the day or season on the man or his tribe.
The codification and expansion of faiths would then be merely the
slow outcome of the cogitations and teachings of reflective minds,
working usually with a refining tendency on the aforesaid primitive
Nature-worship, and in elucidation of its ideas, symbolism, and legends.
Early rude worshippers could not grasp abstractions, nor follow sermons
even if they had been preached, and certainly not recondite theories
on what the West designates ‘Solar,’ and other theories.”—(“Rivers
of Life,” Forlong, vol. i. p. 36.)</p>

<p>“In the Shapast la Shayast (Sacred Books of the East, vol. v. part I.)
much stress is laid on bull’s urine as a purifier.”—(Personal letter
from Professor R. A. Oakes, Watertown, New York, April 20, 1888.)</p>

<p>“During the last few years we have been treated to a great deal of
foolish gush about the beauty and nobility of Eastern religions. I
don’t deny that there are many commendable features about them,
and that they often get near to the heart of true religion, as we understand
it. But in their practical results they cannot be compared with
Christianity. Take a concrete instance:—</p>

<p>“The Rev. T. W. Jex-Blake has this to say about Benares, with its
three thousand Hindu temples: ‘Step into the city,’ he says; ‘one
temple swarms with fœtid apes; another is stercorous with cows. The
stench in the passages leading to the temples is frightful; the filth beneath
your feet is such that the keenest traveller would hardly care to
face it twice. Everywhere, in the temples, in the little shrines in the
street, the emblem of the Creator is phallic. Round one most picturesque
temple, built apparently long since British occupation began,
probably since the battle of Waterloo, runs an external frieze, about
ten feet from the ground, too gross for the pen to describe,—scenes
of vice, natural and unnatural, visible to all the world all day long,
worse than anything in the Lupanar in Pompeii. Nothing that I saw
in India roused me more to a sense of the need of religious renovation
by the Gospel of Christ than what met the eye openly, right and left,
at Benares.” (“Tribune,” New York, Nov. 11, 1888.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Forty years ago, during a stay of three months in Bombay, I saw
frequently cows wandering in the streets, and Hindu devotees bowing,
and lifting up the tails of the cows, rubbing the wombs of the aforesaid
with the right hand, and afterwards rubbing their own faces with it.”—(Personal
letter from Captain Henri Jouan, French Navy, dated
Cherbourg, France, July 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>Almost identical information was communicated by General J. J.
Dana, U. S. Army, who, in the neighborhood of Calcutta, over forty
years ago, had seen Hindu devotees besmeared from head to foot with
human excrement.</p>

<p>Among the superstitious practices of the Greeks, Plutarch mentions
“rolling themselves in dung-hills.” (“Morals,” Goodwin’s trans.,
Boston, 1870, vol. i. p. 171, art. “Superstitions.”) Plutarch also
mentions “foul expiations,” “vile methods of purgation,” “bemirings
at the temple,” and speaks of “penitents wrapped up in foul and nasty
rags,” or “rolling naked in the mire,” “vile and abject adorations,”—(pp.
171-180.)</p>

<p>This veneration for the excrement of the cow is to be found among
other races. The Hottentots “besmear their bodies with fat and other
greasy substances over which they rub cow-dung, fat and similar substances.”—(Thurnberg’s
“Account of the Cape of Good Hope,” in
Pinkerton, vol. xvi. pp. 25, 73, 139.)</p>

<p>“Every idea and thought of the Dinka is how to acquire and maintain
cattle; a certain kind of reverence would seem to be paid them;
even their offal is considered of high importance. The dung, which is
burnt to ashes for sleeping in and for smearing their persons, and
the urine, which is used for washing and as a substitute for salt, are
their daily requisites.”—(Schweinfurth, “Heart of Africa,” vol. i.
p. 58.)</p>

<p>In the religious ceremonies of the Calmuck Lamas, “Les pauvres
jettent au commencement de l’office, qui dure toute la journée, un peu
d’encens sur de la bouse de vache allumée et portée par un petit trépied
de fer.”—(“Voy. de Pallas,” vol. i. p. 563.)</p>

<span class="smaller">ORDURE ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN USED IN FOOD BY THE ISRAELITES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Among the Banians of India, proselytes are obliged by the Brahmans
to eat cow-dung for six months. They begin with one
pound daily, and diminish from day to day. A subtle commentator,
says Picart, might institute a comparison between the nourishment of
these fanatics and the dung of cows which the Lord ordered the
prophet Ezekiel to mingle with his food.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>This was the opinion held by Voltaire on this subject. Speaking of
the prophet Ezekiel, he said: “He is to eat bread of barley, wheat,
beans, lentils, and millet, and to cover it with human excrement.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It
is thus, he says, that the “children of Israel shall eat their bread defiled
among the nations among which they shall be banished.” But
“after having eaten this bread of affliction, God permits him to cover
it with the excrement of cattle simply.”</p>

<p>The view entertained by some biblical commentators is that the
excrement was used for baking the bread; but if this be true, why
should human fæces be used for such a purpose? (Consult Lange’s
Commentaries, article “Ezekiel,” and McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopædia,
article “Dung.”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“For mere filth, what can be fouler than 2 Kings xviii. 27, Isaiah
xxxvi. 12, and Ezekiel iv. 12-15 (where the Lord changes human
ordure into ‘cow chips’)? ‘Ce qui excuse Dieu,’ said Henri Bayle,
‘ce qu’il n’existe pas.’ I add, as man has made him.”—(Richard F.
Burton, “Terminal Essay” to his edition of the “Arabian Nights,”
vol. x. p. 181, foot-note, London, 1886.)</p>

<p>Bayle does not allude to the baking of bread with ordure in his brief
article upon the prophet Ezekiel; neither does Prof. J. Stuart Blaikie
in his more comprehensive dissertation in the Encyclopædia Britannica,
article “Ezekiel.”</p>

<p>“The use of dung by the ancient Israelites is collected incidentally
from the passage in which the prophet Ezekiel, being commanded, as a
symbolic action, to bake his bread with dung, excuses himself from the
use of an unclean thing, and is permitted to employ cow’s dung instead.”—(Strong
and McClintock’s “Cyclopædia of Biblical and Classical
Literature,” New York, 1868, vol. ii. article “Dung.”)</p>

<p>“I fear that Voltaire cannot be taken as an authority on Hebrew
matters. I believe that the passage from Ezekiel is correctly rendered
in the revised edition, where at verse 15 ‘thereon’ is substituted for
‘therewith’ of the old version. The use of dried cow’s-dung as fuel is
common among the poorer classes in the East; and in a siege, fuel, always
scarce, would be so scarce that a man’s dung might have to be
used. I do not think that one need look further for the explanation of
verses 15-17; the words of verse 15 are not ambiguous, and that used
for dung is the same as the Arabs still apply to the dried cakes of cow’s
dung used for fuel. Voltaire and Picart both seem to have used the
Vulgate, in which verse 12 is wrongly rendered.”—(Personal letter
from Prof. W. Robertson Smith, Cambridge, England.)</p>

<p>“Les nombreux exemples qui précèdent rendent moins intéressante
la question de savoir an Ezéchias stercus comederit; ce ne serait qu’un
mangeur de plus. Pourtant on peut voir dans la Bible le verset 12

illud et stercore quod egreditur de homine operies illud in oculis eorum;’

commentateurs.”—(Bibliotheca Scatalogica, pp. 93-96.)</p>

<p>Just exactly what Schurig thought on this subject may be stated

that Ezekiel did eat excrement:—</p>

cuiras avec la fiente qui sort hors de l’homme eux le voyans.”—(“Chylologia,”
Dresden, 1725, pp. 782, 783.)</p>

<p>“Ezekiel says that his God told him to lie for three hundred and
ninety days on his left side, and then forty days on his right side,
when ‘he would lay hands on him and turn him from one side to another;’
also that during all this period he was only to eat barley bread
baked in too disgusting a manner to be described.”—(“Rivers of
Life,” Forlong, vol. ii. p. 597.)</p>

<p>“This last command was, however, so strongly resented that his
Deity somewhat relaxed it.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>The most rational explanation of this much-disputed and ambiguous
passage must necessarily be such as can be deduced from a consideration
of Ezekiel’s environment.</p>

<p>Giving due weight to every doubt, there remains this feature: the
prophet unquestionably was influenced and actuated by the ideas of
his day and generation, which looked upon the humiliations to which
he subjected himself as the outward manifestations of an inward
spirituality.</p>

<p>Psychologically speaking, there is no great difference between the
consumption of human excrement and the act of lying on one’s side for
three hundred and ninety days; both are indications of the same
perverted cerebration, mistaken with such frequency for piety and
holiness.</p>

<p>“Isaiah had periods of indecent maniacal outbursts; for we are told
that he once went about stark naked for three years, because so commanded
by the Lord.”—(“Rivers of Life,” vol. ii. p. 537, quoting
Isaiah xx. 2, 3.)</p>

<h3>THE SACRED COW’S EXCRETA A SUBSTITUTE FOR HUMAN SACRIFICE.</h3>

<p>The foregoing testimony, which could readily be swelled in volume,
proves the sacred character of these excreta, which may be looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
as substitutes for a more perfect sacrifice. In the early life of the
Hindus it is more than likely that the cow or the heifer was slaughtered
by the knife or burnt; as population increased in density, domestic
cattle became too costly to be offered as a frequent oblation,
and on the principle that the part represents the whole, hair, milk, butter,
urine, and ordure superseded the slain carcass, while the incinerated
excrement was made to do duty as a burnt sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>It was hardly probable that such practices, or an explanation of the
causes which led to their adoption and perpetuation, should have
escaped the keen criticism of E. B. Tylor.</p>

<p>“For the means of some of his multifarious lustrations, the Hindu
has recourse to the sacred cow.... The Parsi religion prescribes a
system of lustration which well shows its common origin with that of
Hinduism by its similar use of cow’s urine and water.... Applications
of <i>nirang</i>, washed off with water, form part of the daily religious
rites, as well as of such special ceremonies as the naming of the new-born
child, the putting on of the sacred cord, the purification of the
mother after childbirth, and the purification of him who has touched
a corpse.”—(E. B. Tylor, “Primitive Culture,” London, 1871, vol. ii.
pp. 396, 397.)</p>

<p>“It will help us to realize how the sacrifice of an animal may atone
for a human life, if we notice in South Africa how a Zulu will redeem
a lost child from the finder by a bullock, or a Kimbunda will expiate
the blood of a slave by the offering of an ox, whose blood will wash
away the other. For instances of the animal substituted for man in
sacrifice, the following may serve: Among the Khonds of Orissa, where
Colonel MacPherson was engaged in putting down the sacrifice of human
victims by the sect of the Earth-goddess, they at once began to discuss
the plan of sacrificing cattle by way of substitutes. Now, there is
some reason to think that this same course of ceremonial change may
account for the following sacrificial practice in the other Khond sect.
It appears that those who worship the Light-god hold a festival in his
honor, when they slaughter a buffalo in commemoration of the time
when, as they say, the Earth-goddess was prevailing on men to offer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
human sacrifices to her, but the Light-god sent a tribe-deity who
crushed the bloody-minded Earth-goddess under a mountain and
dragged a buffalo out of the jungle, saying, ‘Liberate the man, and
sacrifice the buffalo.’ It looks as though this legend, divested of its
mythic garb, may really record a historical substitution of animal for
human sacrifice. In Ceylon, the exorcist will demand the name of the
demon possessing a demoniac, and the patient in frenzy answers, giving
the demon’s name, ‘I am So-and-so; I demand a human sacrifice, and I
will not go without.’ The victim is promised, the patient comes to
from the fit, and a few weeks later the sacrifice is made; but instead
of a man they offer a fowl. Classic examples of a substitution of this
sort may be found in the sacrifice of a doe for a virgin to Artemis in
Laodicæa, a goat for a boy to Dionysos at Potniæ.</p>

<p>“There appears to be a Semitic connection here, as there clearly is in
the story of the Æolians of Tenedos sacrificing to Melikertes (Melkarth)
instead of a new-born child a new-born calf, shoeing it with buskins and
tending the mother cow as if a human mother.”—(Idem, vol. ii.
p. 366; or in New York edition, 1879, vol. ii. pp. 403, 404.)</p>

<p>“O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! which is the urine
wherewith the corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and their bodies?
Is it of sheep or of oxen? Is it of man or of woman?</p>

<p>“Ahura Mazda answered: It is of sheep or of oxen, not of man nor
of woman, except these two, the nearest kinsman (of the dead) or his
nearest kinswoman. The worshippers of Mazda shall therefore procure
the urine wherewith the corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and
their bodies.”—(Fargard vii., Avendidad, Zendavesta, Oxford, 1890,
p. 96.)</p>

<p>“A prince may sacrifice his enemy, having first invoked the axe with
holy texts, by substituting a buffalo or goat, calling the victim by the
name of the enemy throughout the whole ceremony.”—(“The Sanguinary
Chapter,” translated from the “Calica Purana,” in vol. 5,
“Transactions Asiatic Society,” 4th edition, London, 1807, p. 386.)</p>

<p>“An interesting chapter of the Aitareya-brahmanam, on the sacrifice
of animals, shows us how, next to man, the horse was the supreme
sacrifice offered to the gods; how the cow afterwards took the place of
the horse, the sheep of the cow, the goat of the sheep; and at last
vegetable products were substituted for animals,—a substitution or
cheating of the gods in the sacrifice, which perhaps explains even more
the fraud of which, in popular stories, the simpleton is always the victim;
the simpleton hero being the god himself, and the cheater man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
who changes, under a sacred pretext, the noblest and most valued animals
for common and less valued ones, and finally for vegetables apparently
of no value whatever. In Hindu codes of law we have the
same fraudulent substitution of animals under a legal pretext. ‘The
killer of a cow,’ says the code attributed to Yagnavalkyas, ‘must stay
a month in penitence, drinking the panchakaryam’ (that is, the five
good productions of the cow, which, according to Manus, are milk, curds,
butter, urine, and dung), sleeping in a stable, and following the cows.’”—(“Zoöl.
Mythol.,” De Gubernatis, vol. i. pp. 44, 45.)</p>

<p>“The sacred books of the Hindus contain the most formal and detailed
instructions about human sacrifices, and on what occasions and
with what ceremonies they are to be offered; sometimes on an enormous
scale,—as many as one hundred and fifty human victims at one
sacrifice.”—(Ragozin, “Assyria,” New York, 1887, pp. 127-128.)</p>

<p>Continuing, Ragozin says: “When bloody sacrifices, even of animals,
were in great part abolished, and offerings of cakes of rice and wheat
were substituted, the humane change was authorized by a parable
which told how the sacrificial virtue had left the highest and most
valuable victim, man, and descended into the horse, from the horse
into the steer, from the steer into the goat, from the goat into the sheep,
and from that at last passed into the earth, where it was found abiding
in the grains of rice and wheat laid in it for seed.</p>

<p>“This was an ingenious way of intimating that henceforth harmless
offerings of rice and wheat cakes would be as acceptable to the
deity as the living victims, human and animal, formerly were.”—(Idem,
p. 128.)</p>

<p>As the animal victim became more and more valuable, we have seen
that its excreta were offered in its place.</p>

<p>The Celtic stock, it is now generally admitted, represents a very early
migration from India. Exactly when this migration began and was
completed we have no means of determining; but we may safely say,
judging from the prominence in Celtic folk-lore of the chicken-dung,
that it did not occur until the cultus of India was beginning to cast
about for some suitable substitute for human sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>Inman takes the ground that the very same substitution occurred
among the Hebrews. Commenting upon 1 Kings xix. 18, he says:
“In the Vulgate the passage is thus rendered: ‘They say to these,
Sacrifice the men who adore the calves;’ while the Septuagint renders
the words, ‘Sacrifice men, for the calves have come to an end,’
indicating a reversion to human sacrifice.”—(Inman, “Ancient Faiths
Embodied in Ancient Names,” London, 1878, article “Hosea.”)</p>

<p>“He that killeth an ox as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a
lamb as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation as if he
offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol.”—(Isaiah
lxvi. 3. Reference given to the above by Prof. W. Robertson
Smith.)</p>

<p>“In the earliest period the horse seems to have been the favorite
animal for sacrifice.”—(“Teutonic Mythology,” Jacob Grimm, vol. i.
p. 47.)</p>

<p>“The Brahmans show how, in Hindostan, the lower animals became
vicarious substitutes for man in sacrifice.”—(“Myth, Ritual, and
Religion,” Andrew Lang, vol. ii. p. 40, footnote.)</p>

<p>If the cow have displaced a human victim, may it not be within
the limits of probability that the ordure and urine of the sacred
bovine are substitutes, not only for the complete carcass, but that they
symbolize a former use of human excreta?<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The existence of ur-orgies
has been indicated in Siberia, where the religion partakes of many of
the characteristics of Buddhism.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The minatory phraseology of the
Brahminical inhibition of the use of the fungi which enter into these
orgies has been given <i>verbatim</i>; so that, even did no better evidence
exist, enough has been presented to open up a wide range of discussion
as to the former area of distribution of loathsome and disgusting
ceremonials, which are now happily restricted to small and
constantly diminishing zones.</p>

<h3>HUMAN ORDURE AND URINE STILL USED IN INDIA.</h3>

<p>It is well to remember, however, that in India the more generally
recognized efficacy of cow urine and cow dung has not blinded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
fanatical devotee to the necessity of occasionally having recourse to
the human product.</p>

<p>“At about ten leagues to the southward of Seringapatam there is a
village called Nan-ja-na-gud, in which there is a temple famous all over
the Mysore. Amongst the number of votaries of every caste who
resort to it, a great proportion consists of barren women, who bring
offerings to the god of the place, and pray for the gift of fruitfulness
in return. But the object is not to be accomplished by the offerings
and prayers alone, the disgusting part of the ceremony being still to
follow. On retiring from the temple, the woman and her husband
repair to the common sewer to which all the pilgrims resort in obedience
to the calls of nature. There the husband and wife collect,
with their hands, a quantity of the ordure, which they set apart, with
a mark upon it, that it may not be touched by any one else; and with
their fingers in this condition, they take the water of the sewer in
the hollow of their hands and drink it. Then they perform ablution
and retire. In two or three days they return to the place of filth to
visit the mass of ordure which they left. They turn it over with their
hands, break it, and examine it in every possible way; and, if they
find that any insects or vermin are engendered in it, they consider it
a favorable prognostic for the woman.”—(Abbé Dubois, “People of
India,” London, 1817, p. 411.)<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">EXCREMENT GODS OF ROMANS AND EGYPTIANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Romans and Egyptians went farther than this; they had gods
of excrement, whose special function was the care of latrines and
those who frequented them. Torquemada, a Spanish author of high
repute, expresses this in very plain language:—</p>

<p>“I assert that they used <i>to adore</i> (as St. Clement writes to St. James
the Less) stinking and filthy privies and water-closets; and, what is
viler and yet more abominable, and an occasion for our tears and not
to be borne with or so much as mentioned by name, they adored the
noise and wind of the stomach when it expels from itself any cold or
flatulence; and other things of the same kind, which, according to the
same saint, it would be a shame to name or describe.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In the preceding lines Torquemada refers to the Egyptians only,
but, as will be seen by examining the Spanish notes below, his
language is almost the same when speaking of the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The
Roman goddess was called Cloacina. She was one of the first of the
Roman deities, and is believed to have been named by Romulus himself.
Under her charge were the various cloacæ, sewers, privies, etc.,
of the Eternal City.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Les anciens avaient fait plusieurs divinités du Stercus; 1. Stercus
ou Sterces, père de Picus, inventeur de la méthode de fumer les terres
(S. August. De Civ. Dei, lib. xviii. cap. 15). 2. Sterculius
(Macrob., Saturn., lib. i. cap. 7); 3. Stercutius (Lactant. de fal. reb.),
Stercutus, Sterquilinus, Sterquiline, divinités qui présidaient aux engrais.
Quelques personnes croient que c’était un surnom de Saturne
comme inventeur de l’agriculture; d’autres y reconnaissent la terre
elle-même. Pline dit que ce dieu était fils du dieu Faune et petit-fils
de Picus, roi des Latins.—(Pline, lib. xvii. cap. 9, num. 40; Persius,
sat. i. ver. 3.)</p>

<p>“On honore aussi Faunus avec les deux derniers surnoms.”—(Pline,
loc. cit. Bib. Scat.)</p>

médailles, Lactant. Instit. lib. i. cap. 20, p. 11; St. Cyp. Van. d. id.

Scat. p. 43, footnote.)</p>

<p>As far as possible, the above citations were verified; the edition of
St. Augustine consulted was that of the Reverend Maurice Dods,
Edinburgh, 1871.</p>

<p>“Tatius both discovered and worshipped Cloacina.”—(Minutius
Felix, “Octavius,” cap. xxv., edition of Edinburgh, 1869.)</p>

<p>“Colatina, alias Clocina, was goddess of the stools, the jakes, and
the privy, to whom, as to every of the rest, there was a peculiar
temple edified.”—(Reginald Scot, “Discovery of Witchcraft,”? lib. 16,
cap. 22, giving a list of the Roman gods.)</p>

<p>“Stercus, Dieu particulier qui présidait à la garde-robe. Ce dernier
nous rappelle qu’à l’art. Scopetarius, num. 111, nous avons dit quelques
mots de Cloacine, déesse des égouts.</p>

<p>“On trouve encore dans Arnobe un dieu Latrinus duquel il dit:
‘Quis Latrinus præsidem latrinis?’”—(Adv. Gent. lib. 4.)</p>

<p>“Horace et tous les poëtes du temps d’Auguste, parlent de Stercus
et ses circonstances et dépendances en cent endroits de leurs ouvrages.
Martial, Catulle, Pétrone, Macrobe, Lucrèce, en saupoudrent leurs
poésies; Homère, Pline, Lampride en parlent à ciel et à cœurs couverts;

et profond,—‘La matière est-elle louable?’ Il trouve dans
les excréments le secret des souffrances humaines. Son trépied prophétique
et médical, c’est une chaise percée.—(Idem, p. 66.)</p>

<p>“Sterculius. (Myth.) surnom donné à Saturne, parcequ’il fut le
premier qui apprit aux hommes à fumer les terres pour les rendre fertiles.”—(“Encyc.
Raisonnée des Sciences,” etc., Neufchatel, 1765,

<p>The Romans “had a god of ordure named Stercutius; one for other
conveniences, Crepitus; a goddess for the common sewers, Cloacina.”—(Banier,
“Mythology,” vol. i. p. 199.)</p>

<p>“Sterculius was one of the surnames given to Saturn because he was
the first that had laid dung upon lands to make them fertile.”—(Idem,
vol. ii. p. 540.)</p>

<h3>THE ASSYRIAN VENUS HAD OFFERINGS OF DUNG PLACED UPON HER
ALTARS.</h3>

<p>Another authority states that “the zealous adorers of Siva rub the
forehead, breast, and shoulders with ashes of cow-dung,” and, further,
he adds: “It is very remarkable that the Assyrian Venus, according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Lucian, had also offerings of dung placed upon her altars.”—(Maurice,
“Indian Antiquities,” London, 1800, vol. i. pp. 172, 173.)<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h3>THE MEXICAN GODDESS SUCHIQUECAL EATS ORDURE.</h3>

<p>The Mexicans had a goddess, of whom we read the following:—Father
Fabreya says, in his commentary on the Codex Borgianus, that
the mother of the human race is there represented in a state of humiliation,
eating <i>cuitlatl</i> (<i>kopros</i>, Greek). The vessel in the left hand of
Suchiquecal contains “<i>mierda</i>,” according to the interpreter of these
paintings.—(See note to p. 120, Kingsborough’s “Mexican Antiquities,”
vol. iv.)</p>

<p>The Spanish <i>mierda</i>, like the Greek <i>kopros</i>, means <i>ordure</i>.</p>

<p>Besides Suchiquecal, the mother of the gods, who has been represented
as eating excrement in token of humiliation, the Mexicans had
other deities whose functions were more or less clearly complicated
with alvine dejections. The most prominent of these was Ixcuina
called, also, Tlaçolteotl, of whom Brasseur de Bourbourg speaks in
these terms: The goddess of ordure, or Tlaçolquani, the <i>eater of ordure</i>,
because she presided over loves and carnal pleasures.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Mendieta mentions her as masculine, and in these terms: The god
of vices and dirtinesses, whom they called Tlazulteotl.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Bancroft speaks of “the Mexican goddess of carnal love, called Tlazoltecotl,
Ixcuina, Tlacloquani,” etc., and says that she “had in
her service a crowd of dwarfs, buffoons, and hunchbacks, who diverted
her with their songs and dances and acted as messengers to such gods
as she took a fancy to. The last name of this goddess means “eater
of filthy things,” referring, it is said, to her function of hearing and
pardoning the confessions of men and women guilty of unclean and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
carnal crimes.—(Bancroft, H. H. “Native Races of the Pacific Slope,”
vol. iii. p. 380.)</p>

<p>In the manuscript explaining the Codex Telleriano, given in Kingsborough’s
“Mexican Antiquities,” vol. v. p. 131, occurs the name of
the goddess Ochpaniztli, whose feast fell on the 12th of September of
our calendar. She was described as “the one who sinned by eating
the fruit of the tree.” The Spanish monks styled her, as well as
another goddess, Tlaçolteotl,—“La diosa de basura ó pecado.” But
“basura” is not the alternative of sin (pecado); it means “dung,
manure, ordure, excrement.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It is possible that, in their zeal to discover
analogies between the Aztec and Christian religions, the early
missionaries passed over a number of points now left to conjecture.</p>

<p>In the same volume of Kingsborough, p. 136, there is an allusion
to the offerings or sacrifices made Tepeololtec, “que, en romance,
quiere decir sacrificios de mierda,” which, “in plain language, signifies
sacrifices of excrement.” Nothing further can be adduced upon the
subject, although a note at the foot of this page, in Kingsborough,
says that here several pages of the Codex Talleriano had been obliterated
or mutilated, probably by some over-zealous expurgator.</p>

<p>Deities, created in the ignorance or superstitious fears of devotees,
are essentially man-like in their attributes; where they are depicted as
cruel and sanguinary toward their enemies, the nation adoring them,
no matter how pacific to-day, was once cruel and sanguinary likewise.
Anthropophagous gods are worshipped only by the descendants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
cannibals, and excrement-eaters only by the progeny of those who
were not unacquainted with human ordure as an article of food.</p>

<h3>ISRAELITISH DUNG GODS.</h3>

<p>Dulaure quotes from a number of authorities to show that the Israelites
and Moabites had the same ridiculous and disgusting ceremonial in
their worship of Bel-phegor. The devotee presented his naked posterior
before the altar and relieved his entrails, making an offering to the
idol of the foul emanations.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Dung gods are also mentioned as having
been known to the chosen people during the time of their idolatry.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Mr. John Frazer, LL.D., describing the ceremony of initiation, known
to the Australians as the “Bora,” and which he defines to be “certain
ceremonies of initiation through which a youth passes when he reaches
the age of puberty to qualify him for a place among the men of the
tribe and for the privileges of manhood. By these ceremonies he is
made acquainted with his father’s gods, the mythical lore of the tribe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and the duties required of him as a man.... The whole is under the
tutelage of a high spirit called ‘Dharamoolun.’ ... But, present at
these ceremonies, although having no share in them, is an evil spirit
called ‘Gunungdhukhya,’ ‘eater of excrement,’ whom the blacks greatly
dread.” Compare this word “Gunungdhukhya,” with the Sanskrit
root-word “Gu,” “excrement;” “Dhuk” is the Australian “to eat.”—(Personal
letter from John Frazer, Esq., LL.D., dated Sydney, New
South Wales, Dec. 24, 1889. Continuing his remarks upon the subject
of the evil spirit “Gunungdhukhya,” he says: “This being is certainly
supposed to eat ordure; and such is the meaning of his name.”)</p>

<p>King James gravely informs us that “Witches ofttimes confesse that
in their worship of the Devil.... Their form of adoration to be the
kissing of his hinder parts.”—(“Dæmonologie,” London, 1616, p.
113.) This book appeared with a commendatory preface from Hinton,
one of the bishops of the English Church.</p>

<p>“Witches paid homage to the devil who was present, usually in the
form of a goat, dog, or ape. To him they offered themselves, body and
soul, and kissed him under the tail, holding a lighted candle.”—(“History
of the Inquisition,” Henry C. Lea, New York, 1888, vol. iii.,
p. 500.)</p>

<p>Knowing of the existence of “dung gods” among Romans, Egyptians,
Hebrews, and Moabites, it is not unreasonable to insist, in the
present case, upon a rigid adherence to the text, and to assert that,
where it speaks of a sacrifice as a sacrifice of excrement and designates
a deity as an eater of excrement, it means what it says, and should not
be distorted, under the plea of symbolism, into a perversion of facts
and ideas.</p>

<p>Some writers made out the name of the god “Belzebul” to be identical
with “Beelzebub,” and to mean “Lord of Dung,” but this interpretation
is disputed by Schaff-Herzog.—(“Encyclopædia of Religious
Knowledge,” New York, article “Beelzebub.”)</p>

<p>The mention of the Roman goddess Cloacina suggests an inquiry
into the general history of latrines and urinals. Their introduction
cannot be ascribed to purely hygienic considerations, since many
nations of comparatively high development have managed to get along
without them; while, on the other hand, tribes in low stages of culture
have resorted to them.</p>

<p>In the chapter treating upon witchcraft and incantation enough testimony
has been accumulated to convince the most sceptical that the
belief was once widely diffused of the power possessed by sorcerers, <i>et id
omne genus</i>, over the unfortunate wretches whose excreta, solid or liquid,
fell into their hands; terror may, therefore, have been the impelling
motive for scattering, secreting, or preserving in suitable receptacles
the alvine dejections of a community. Afterwards, as experience
taught men that in these egestæ were valuable fertilizers for the fields
and vineyards, or fluids for bleaching and tanning, the political authorities
made their preservation a matter of legal obligation.</p>

<p>The Trojans defecated in the full light of day, if we can credit the
statement made to that effect in the “Bibliotheca Scatalogica,” p. 8, in
which it is shown that a French author (name not given) wrote a
facetious but erudite treatise upon this subject.</p>

<p>Captain Cook tells us that the New Zealanders had privies to every
three or four of their houses; he also takes occasion to say that there
were no privies in Madrid until 1760; that the determination of the
king to introduce them and sewers, and to prohibit the throwing of
human ordure out of windows after nightfall, as had been the custom,
nearly precipitated a revolution.—(See in Hawkesworth’s “Voyages,”
London, 1773, vol. ii. p. 314.)</p>

<p>“These were more cleanly than most savages about excrements.
Every house had a concealed (if possible) privy near, and in large
‘Pas’ a pole was run out over the cliff to sit on sailor-fashion.”—(“The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Maoris of New Zealand,” E. Tregear, in “Journal of the Anthropological
Institute,” London, November, 1889.)</p>

<p>Marquesas Islands. “They are peculiarly cleanly in regard to the
egestæ. At the Society Islands the wanderer’s eyes and nose are
offended every morning in the midst of a path with the natural effects
of a sound digestion; but the natives of the Marquesas are accustomed,
after the manner of our cats, to bury the offensive objects in the earth.
At Taheite, indeed, they depend on the friendly assistance of rats, who
greedily devour these odoriferous dainties; nay, they seem to be convinced
that their custom is the most proper in the world; for their
witty countryman, Tupaya, found fault with our want of delicacy when
he saw a small building appropriated to the rites of Cloacina, in every
house at Batavia.”—(Forster, “Voyage round the World,” London,
1777, vol. ii. p. 28.)</p>

<p>Forster speaks of the traffic between the English sailors and the
women of Tahiti, in which the latter parted with their personal favors
in return for red feathers and fresh pork; in consequence of a too free
indulgence in this heavy food, the ladies suffered from indigestion.
“The goodness of their appetites and digestion, exposed them, however,
to inconveniences of restlessness, and often disturbed those who
wished to sleep after the fatigues of the day. On certain urgent occasions
they always required the attendance of their lovers; but, as they
were frequently refused, the decks were made to resemble the paths in
the islands.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 83.)</p>

<p>In ancient Rome there were public latrines, but no privies attached
to houses. There were basins and tubs, which were emptied
daily by servants detailed for the purpose. No closet-paper was in
use, as may be imagined, none having yet been invented or introduced
in Europe, but in each public latrine, there was a bucket filled with
salt water, and a stick having a sponge tied to one end, with which
the passer-by cleansed his person, and then replaced the stick in the
tub.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Seneca, in his Epistle No. 70, describes the suicide of a German
slave who rammed one of these sticks down his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>The warning “Commit no nuisance,” or in French “Il est défendu de
faire ici des ordures,” is traceable back to the time of the Romans,
who devoted to the wrath of the twelve great gods, “and of Jupiter
and Diana as well, all who did any indecency in the neighborhood of
the temples or monuments.” “On nous saura gré de rapporter ici une
inscription qui se lisait autrefois sur les thermes de Titus; ‘Duodecim
Dios et Dianam et Jovem Optimum Maximum habeat iratos quisquis hic
minxerit aut cacarit.’” In Genoa, excommunication was threatened
against all who infringed upon this same prohibition.</p>

<p>Privies were ordered for each house in Paris in 1513, whence we
may infer that some house-builders had previously of their own impulse
added such conveniences; as early as 1372, and again in 1395,
there were royal ordinances forbidding the throwing of ordures out of
the windows in Paris, which gives us the right to conclude that the
custom must have been general and offensive; the same dispositions
were taken for the city of Bordeaux in 1585.</p>

<p>Obscene poetry was known in latrines in Rome as in our own day,
and some of the compositions have come down to us.—(See “Bibliotheca
Scatalogica,” pp. 13-17.)</p>

<p>The Romans protected their walls “against such as commit nuisances ... by
consecrating the walls so exposed with the picture of a
deity or some other hallowed emblem, and by denouncing the wrath of
heaven against those who should be impious enough to pollute what it
was their duty to reverence. The figure of a snake, it appears, was
sometimes employed for this purpose.... The snake, it is well
known, was reckoned among the gods of the heathens.”—(“Vestiges
of Ancient Manners and Customs,” Rev. John James Blunt, London,
1823, p. 43.)</p>

<p>Herodotus informs his readers that the Egyptians “ease themselves
in their houses, but eat out of doors, alleging that whatever is indecent,
though necessary, ought to be done in private, but what is not indecent
openly.”—(“Euterpe,” p. 35.)</p>

<p>Herodotus also speaks of the Egyptian king Amasis having made an
idol out of a gold foot-pan, “in which the Egyptians formerly vomited,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
made water, and washed their feet” (“Euterpe”). Minutius Felix,
in his “Octavius,” refers to this, and takes umbrage that heathen idols
made of such foul materials should be adored (see his chapter xxv.).</p>

<p>Tournefort mentions latrines in Marseilles. “They make advantage
of the very excrements of the Gally-Slaves by placing at one end of the
Gallies proper vessels for receiving a manure so necessary to the country.”—(“A
Voyage to the Levant,” edition of London, 1718, vol. i.
pp. 13-14.)</p>

<p>There must have been latrines in Scotland, because James I. of that
kingdom was killed in one in the Monastery of the Black Friars, in Perth,
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1437; yet for many years later pedestrians in the streets of
Edinburgh, after night-fall, took their own risks of the filthy deluge
which house-maids were wont to pour down from the windows of the
lofty houses.</p>

<p>“As in modern Edinburgh so in ancient Rome, night was the time
observed by the careful housekeeper for throwing her slops from the
upper windows into the open drain that ran through the street beneath.”—(Footnote
to page 146 of Edward Walford’s (M.A. of Baliol, Oxford)
ed. of Juvenal, in “Ancient Classics for English Readers,” Philadelphia,
1872, quoting from Juvenal the line, “Clattering the storm
descends from heights unknown,” Satire III., line 274.)</p>

<p>“And behold, there is nurra goaks in the whole kingdom (Scotland),
nor anything for pore servants, but a barrel with a pair of tongs thrown
across, and all the chairs of the family are emptied into this here barrel
once a day; and at ten o’clock at night the whole cargo is flung out
of a back windere that looks into some street or lane, and the maid
calls, ‘Gardy loo!’ to the passengers, which signifies, ‘Lord have

McGillvrays.... All the old jokes on hills without trees, girls without
stockings, men eating the food of horses, pails emptied from the
fourteenth story, were pointed against these lucky adventurers.”—(T.
B. Macaulay, “The Earl of Chatham,” American edition, Appleton
and Co., New York, 1874, p. 720.)</p>

<p>The addition of privies to the homes of the gentry would appear to
have been an innovation in the time of Queen Elizabeth, else there
would not have been so much comment made upon the action of Sir
John Harington, her distant cousin, who erected one as a fitting convenience
to his new house, near Bath, and published a very Rabelaisian
volume upon the subject in London in 1596. The title of the book,
being quite long,—“A Discourse on a Stale Subject, called the Metamorphosis
of Ajax,”—will in subsequent citations be given simply as
Harington’s “Ajax.” From the description of the latrine in question
there is no doubt that Harington anticipated nearly all the mechanism
of modern days.</p>

<p>Richard III. is represented as having been seated in a latrine, “sitting
on a draught,” when he was “devising with Terril how to have
his nephews privily murdered.”—(Harington, “Ajax,” p. 46.)</p>

<p>There is little reason to doubt that all houses in England, and all
Continental Europe as well, were provided with receptacles for urine
in the bed-chambers, even if no regular latrines existed outside of the
monasteries and other community-houses. Dr. Robert Fletcher, U. S.
Army, who has contributed the following, is of the opinion that these
conveniences were provided for ladies only, and submits the following
passages in support of his conclusions:—</p>

<p>“Hamjo, in the ‘Wanderer,’ part 2, by Sir Thomas Killigrew, describing
to Senilia the probable manners of a rude husband, says that,
on retiring to bed, ‘the gyant stretches himself, yawns, and sighs
a belch or two, stales in your pot, farts as loud as a musket for a
jest,’” etc.</p>

<p>In Douce’s “Illustrations of Shakspeare” is a curious print of a
bishop blessing a newly married pair in the bridal bed; on the lady’s
side a chamber-pot is ostentatiously displayed.</p>

<p>Douce quotes the following from a rare “Morality,” entitled, “Le
Condemnation des Banquets:” “Pause pour pisser le fol. Il prengt
un coffinet en lieu de orinal et pisse dedans et tout coule par bas.”</p>

<p>Hobbs, the Tanner of Tamworth, introduced by Heywood in his play
of “King Edward the Fourth,” the hero of the old ballad, furnished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
his rooms with urinals suited to his trade. He says to his guests, the
King and Sellinger: “Come, take away, and let’s to bed. Ye shall
have clean sheets, Ned; but they be coarse, good strong hemp, of my
daughter’s own spinning. And I tell thee your chamber-pot must be
a fair horn, a badge of our occupation; for we buy no bending pewter
nor breaking earth.”—(“1 King Edward the Fourth,” iii. 2, Heywood,
1600.)</p>

<p>Additional references of the same tenor are to be found in the “Pilgrims,”
Beaumont and Fletcher, ii. 1: “The Scourge of Villanie,”
Marston, 1599, satire 2; and in the following, which does not accord
with Dr. Fletcher’s opinion that such utensils were provided solely for
the female members of the household.</p>

<p>“<i>Host.</i> Hostlers, you knaves and commanders, take the horses of
the knights and competitors; your honorable hulks have put into harbor;
they’ll take in fresh water here, and I have provided clean
chamber-pots.”—(“The Merry Devil of Edmonton,” 1608.)</p>

<p>Such vessels were in use in Ireland, where they were called “omar-fuail,”
from <i>omar</i>, a vessel, and <i>fuail</i>, urine. They must have been
employed from the earliest centuries. “And they (the Sybarites)
were the first people who introduced the custom of bringing chamber-pots
into entertainments” (Athenaus, book xii. cap. 17).</p>

<p>It is not easy to detect any essential difference between the manners
of the people of Iceland, as described by Bleekmans on another page,
and those of the more polished Romans.</p>

<p>Bed-pans were used in France in the earliest days of the fifteenth
century. They are noted in “The Farce of Master Pathelin” (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1480).—(See “Le Moyen Age Médical,” Dupouy, Paris, 1888, p. 280
<i>et seq.</i>, and the translation of the same by Minor, Cincinnati, Ohio,
1890, p. 82.)</p>

<p>“In the ‘Chronicle of London,’ written in the fifteenth century, a
curious anecdote is related, to the effect that in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1258-60, a Jew,
on Saturday, fell into a ‘privy’ at Tewksbury, but out of reverence
for his Sabbath, would not allow himself to be drawn out. The next
day being Sunday, the Earl of Gloucester would not let any one draw
him out;” and so, says the Chronicle, “the Jew died in the privy.”—(“A
Chronicle of London from 1089 to 1483,” London, 1827, p. 20,
quoted by Buckle in “Commonplace Book,” p. 507, in vol. ii. of his
Works, London, 1872.)</p>

<p>“Heliogabalus’ body was thrown into a jakes, as writeth Suetonius.”—(Harington’s
“Ajax,” p. 46.)</p>

<p>Heliogabalus was killed in one (latrine); Arius, the great heresiarch,
and Pope Leo, his antagonist, had the same fate. Charles the
Fifth, Emperor of Germany and Spain, was born in one in the palace
of Ghent, of Jeanne of Aragon, in 1500; hence, they must have been
introduced in the localities named.—(See Biblioth. Scatal. p. 17.)</p>

<p>“Urinary reservoirs were erected in the streets of Rome, either for
the purpose of public cleanliness, or for the use of the fullers, who
were accustomed to purchase their contents of the Roman government
during the reign of Vespasian, and perhaps other emperors, at a certain
annual impost, and which, prior to the invention or general use of
soap, was the substance employed principally in their mills for cleansing
cloths and stuffs previous to their being dyed.”—(John Mason
Good, translation of Lucretius’ “De Natura Rerum,” London, 1805,
vol. ii. p. 154, footnote.)</p>

<p>“Vases, called Gastra, for the relief of passengers, were placed by
the Romans upon the edges of roads and streets.”—(Fosbroke,
“Encyc. of Ant.,” London, vol. i. p. 526, article “Urine.”)</p>

<p>“Les Chinois semblent manquer d’engrais, car on trouve de tous
côtés des lieux d’aisance pour les besoins des voyageurs.”—(“Voyage
à Pékin,” De Guignes, Paris, 1808, vol. i. p. 284; and again, vol. iii.
p. 322.)</p>

<p>“Large vases of stone-ware are sunk in the ground at convenient
places for the use of passing travellers.”—(“Chinese Repository,”
Canton, 1835, vol. iii. p. 134.)</p>

<p>“A traveller who lately returned from Pekin asserts that there is
plenty to smell in that city, but very little to see.... The houses
are all very low and mean, the streets are wholly unpaved, and are
always very muddy and very dusty, and as there are no sewers or cess-pools,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the filthiness of the town is indescribable.”—(“Chicago News,”
copied in the “Press,” Philadelphia, Penn., May 14, 1889.)</p>

<p>“By the Mahometan law, the body becomes unclean after each
evacuation ... both greater and smaller ... requires an ablution,
according to circumstances.... If a drop of urine touches the
clothes, they must be washed.” For fear that their garments have
been so defiled, “the Bokhariots frequently repeat their prayers stark
naked.” ... The matter of cleaning the body after an evacuation of
any kind is defined by religious ritual. “The law commands ‘Istindjah’
(removal), ‘istinkah’ (ablution), and ‘istibra’ (drying,)”—i. e.,
a small clod of earth is first used for the local cleansing, then
water at least twice, and finally a piece of linen a yard in length....
In Turkey, Arabia, and Persia all are necessary, and pious men carry
several clods of earth for the purpose in their turbans. “These
acts of purification are also carried on quite publicly in the bazaars,
from a desire to make a parade of their consistent piety.” Vambéry
saw “a teacher give to his pupils, boys and girls, instruction in the
handling of the clod of earth, and so forth, by way of experiment.”—(“Sketches
of Central Asia,” Arminius Vambéry, London, 1868,
pp. 190, 191.)</p>

<p>Moslems urinate sitting down on their heels; “for a spray of urine
would make hair and clothes ceremonially impure.... After urining,
the Moslem wipes the os penis with one to three bits of stone, clay, or
a handful of earth, and he must perform Wuzu before he can pray.”
Tournefort (“Voyage au Levant,” vol. iii. p. 355) tells a pleasant story
about certain Christians at Constantinople who powdered with poivre
d’Inde the stones in a wall where the Moslems were in the habit of
rubbing the os penis by way of wiping.—(Burton, “Arabian Nights,”
vol. ii. p. 326. Again, in footnote to p. 229, vol. iii., he says, “Scrupulous
Moslems scratch the ground in front of their feet with a stick,
to prevent spraying and consequent defilement.”)</p>

<p>Marco Polo, in speaking of the Brahmins, says, “They ease themselves
in the sands, and then disperse it, hither and thither, lest it
should breed worms, which might die for want of food.”—(“Travels,”
in Pinkerton, vol. vii. pp. 164, 165.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the Mahometans, Tournefort says, “When they make
water, they squat down like women, for fear some drops of urine
should fall into their breeches. To prevent this evil, they squeeze the
part very carefully, and rub the head of it against the wall; and one
may see the stones worn in several places by this custom. To make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
themselves sport, the Christians smear the stones sometimes with
Indian pepper and the root called ‘Calf’s-Foot,’ or some other hot
plants, which frequently causes an inflammation in such as happen to
use the Stone. As the pain is very smart, the poor Turks commonly
run for a cure to those very Christian surgeons who were the authors
of all the mischief. They never fail to tell them it is a very dangerous
case, and that they should be obliged, perhaps, to make an
amputation. The Turks, on the contrary, protest and swear that they
have had no communication with any sort of woman that could be
suspected. In short, they wrap up the suffering part in a Linen
dipped in Oxicrat tinctured with a little Bole-Armenic; and this they
sell them as a great specifick for this kind of Mischief.”—(Tournefort,
“A Voyage to the Levant,” London, 1718, vol. ii. p. 49.)</p>

<p>“Some of their doctors believe Circumcision was not taken from the
Jews, but only for the better observing the Precept of Cleanness, by
which they are forbidden to let any Urine fall upon their flesh. And
it is certain that some drops are always apt to hang upon the Præputium,
especially among the Arabians, with whom that skin is naturally
much longer than in other men.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 46.)</p>

<p>The Mahometans have “Two ablutions, the great and small....
The first is of the whole body, but this is enjoined only to” those
“who have let some urine drop upon their flesh when they have made
water.” This he enumerates among “The Three great Defilements
of the Mussulmans.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 48.)</p>

<p>John Leo says of those “Arabians which inhabit in Barborie, or
upon the Coast of the Mediterranean Sea.... Their churches they
frequent very diligently, to the end they may repeat certain prescript
and formall Praiers, most sperstitiously perswading themselves that
the same day wherein they make their praiers, it is not lawfull for
them to wash certaine of their members, when, as at other times, they
will wash their whole bodies.”—(“Observations of Africa,” in Purchas’s
“Pilgrims,” vol. ii. p. 766.)</p>

<p>“Les lieux destinés à la décharge de la nature ... sont toujours
propres.... Les Turcs ne sont point assis comme nous quand ils
sont en ces lieux-là, mais ils s’accroupissent sur le trou qui n’est relevé
de terre que d’un demy-pied ou d’un peu plus.... Les Turcs
et tous les Mahométans en général ne se servent point de papier à de
vils usages, et quand ils vont à ces sortes de lieux ils portent un pot
plein d’eau pour se laver.”—(J. B. Tavernier, “Relation de l’intérieur
du Sérail du Grand Seigneur,” Paris, 1675, p. 194.)</p>

<p>Rabelais has written a characteristic chapter on the expedients to
which men resorted before the general introduction of paper for use in
latrines; see his chapter xiii., “Anisterges.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could be more filthy than the state of the palace and all
the lanes leading up to it. It was well, perhaps, that we were never
expected to go there; for without stilts and respirators it would have
been impracticable, such is the filthy nature of the people. The king’s
cows even are kept in his palace enclosure, the calves actually entering
the hut, where, like a farmer, Kamresi walks among them, up to his
ankles in filth, and inspecting them, issues his orders concerning
them.”—(Speke, “Nile,” London, 1863, vol. ii. p. 526, describing the
palace of King Kamresi, at the head of the Nile.)</p>

<p>“Shortly afterwards, a disturbance arose between some of my people
and the natives, owing to one of my men who retired into a patch
of cultivated ground having been discovered there by the owner. He
demanded compensation for his land having been defiled, and had to
be appeased by a present of cloth. If they were only half as particular
about their dwellings as their fields, it would be a good thing, for
their villages are filthy in the extreme, and would be even worse but
for the presence of large numbers of pigs which act as scavengers.”—(“Across
Africa,” Cameron, London, 1877, vol. ii. p. 200.)</p>

<p>“I was disgusted with the custom which prevailed in the houses
like that in which I was lodged, of using the terrace as a sort of closet;
and I had great difficulty in preventing my guide, Amer el Walati,
who still stayed with me and made the terrace his usual residence, from
indulging in the filthy practice.”—(Dr. Henry Barth, “Travels in
North and Central Africa,” Philadelphia, 1859, p. 429, description of
Timbuctoo.)</p>

<p>“They (the Tartars) hold it not good to abide long in one place,
for they will say when they will curse any of their children, ‘I would
thou mightest tarry so long in one place that thou mightest smell
thine own dung as the Christians do;’ and this is the greatest curse
they have.”—(“Notes of Richard Johnson, servant to Master Richard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Chancellor,” in Pinkerton, vol. i. p. 62. “Voyages of Sir Hugh Willoughby
and others to the Northern parts of Siberia and Russia.”)</p>

<p>The Tungouses of Siberia told Sauer that “they knew no greater
curse than to live in one place like a Russian or Yakut, where filth
accumulates and fills the inhabitants with stench and disease.”—(Sauer,
“Expedition to the North parts of Russia,” London, 1802, p. 49.)</p>

<p>“It is a common obloquy that the Turks (who still keep the order
of Deuteronomy for their ordure) do object to Christians that they are
poisoned with their own dung.”—(Harington, “Ajax,” p. 115.)</p>

<p>“The aspect of the village itself is very neat, the ground being often
swept before the chief houses; but very bad odors abound, owing to
there being under each house a stinking mud-hole, formed by all waste
liquids and refuse matter poured down through the floor above. In
most other things, Malays are tolerably clean—in some scrupulously
so—and this peculiar and nasty custom, which is almost universal,
arises, I have little doubt, from their having been originally a water-loving
and maritime people, who built their houses on posts in the
water, and only migrated gradually inland, first up the rivers and
streams, and then into the dry interior.</p>

<p>“Habits which were once so convenient and cleanly, and which had
been so long practised as to become a part of the domestic life of the
nation, were of course continued when the first settlers built their
houses inland; and, without a regular system of drainage, the arrangement
of the villages is such that any other system would be very
inconvenient.”—(“The Malay Archipelago,” Alfred Russell Wallace,
London, 1869, vol. i. p. 126.)</p>

<p>Forster speaks of “an intolerable stench which arises from the many
tanks dispersed in the different quarters of the town, whose waters and
borders are appropriated to the common use of the inhabitants”
(“Sketch of the Mythology of the Hindoos,” George Forster, London,
1785, p. 7); but, he adds, “The filth alone which is indiscriminately
thrown into the street.”</p>

<p>“There are some Guai, which ... dawbe ouer their houses with Oxe-dung....
They touch not their meat with the left hand, but use that
hand only to wipe and other unclean offices.”—(Marco Polo, in Purchas,
vol. i. p. 105.)</p>

<p>“Having list at any time to ease themselves, the filthy lousels had
not the manners to withdraw themselves further from us than a Beane
can be cast. Yea, like vile slouens, they would lay their tails in our
presence, while they were yet talking with us.”—(Friar William de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Rubruquis, the Franciscan, sent by Saint Louis, of France (King Louis
IX.), as ambassador to the Grand Khan of Tartary in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1235,—in
Purchas, vol. i. p. 11.)</p>

<p>“A great magnifico of Venice, being ambassador in France, and
hearing a noble person was come to speak with him, made him stay till
he had untied his points; and when he was new set upon his stool,
sent for the nobleman to come to him at that time, as a very special
favor.”—(Harington, “Ajax,” p. 30.)</p>

<p>“The French courtesy I spake of before came from the Romans;
since in Martial’s time, they shunned not one another’s company at
Monsieur Ajax.” (“Ajax” as used by Harington, is a play upon the
words “a Jakes.”)—(See Harington, “Ajax,” p. 38.)</p>

<p>Carl Lumholtz stated to the author that the Australians urinate in
the presence of strangers, and while talking to them.</p>

<p>“Il n’est fonction physiologique ou besoin naturel qu’ils aient gêne à
satisfaire en public. ‘Une coutume n’a rien d’indécent quand elle est
universelle,’ remarque philosophiquement un de nos voyageurs.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” Elie Réclus, Paris, 1885, p. 71,—“Les Inoits Occidentaux,”
quoting Dall.)</p>

<p>Padre Gumilla says that the Indians on the Orinoco have the same
custom as the Jews and Turks have of digging holes with a hoe and
covering up their evacuations. (See “Orinoco,” Madrid, 1741, p. 109.)
No such cleanliness can be attributed to the Indians of the Plains of
North America or the nomadic tribes of the Southwest.</p>

<p>“And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt
turn back and cover that which cometh from thee.</p>

<p>“For the Lord, thy God, walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver
thee and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall
thy camp be holy; that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn
away from thee.”—(Deuteronomy xxiii.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the Essenes, Josephus informs us: “On the seventh
day ... they will not even remove any vessel out of its place, nor perform
the most pressing necessities of nature. Nay, on other days they
dig a small pit, a foot deep, with a paddle (which kind of hatchet is
given them when they first are admitted among them), and, covering
themselves round with their garment, that they may not affront the
divine rays of light, they ease themselves into that pit. After which
they put the earth that was dug out again into that pit.</p>

<p>“And even this they do only in the most lonesome places, which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
choose for this purpose. And it is a rule with them to wash themselves
afterwards, as if it were a defilement.”—(“Wars of the Jews,”
edition of New York, 1821, p. 241.)</p>

<p>“The Rabbinical Jews believed that every privy was the abode of an
unclean spirit of this kind” (i. e., an excrement-eating god), “which
could be inhaled with the breath, and descending into the lower parts
of the body, lodge there, and thus like the Bhutas of India, bring
suffering and disease.” (Personal letter from John Frazer, Esq., LL.D.,
Sydney, New South Wales, Dec. 24, 1889.)</p>

<p>In descriptions of Jerusalem, we read of the “Dung Gate,” by or
through which, all the fecal matter of the city had to be carried.—(See
Harington, “Ajax,” p. 87.)</p>

<p>“When an aborigine obeys a call of nature, he always carries a
pointed instrument with which to turn up the ground, so that his
fecal excreta may be hidden from the keen vision of the vagabond
Bangals.” (“Bangals” are the native witches or their parallels.)—(“Aborigines
of Victoria and Riverina,” A. Brough-Smith, vol. i.
p. 165.)</p>

<p>The same custom has been ascribed to the Dyaks of Borneo. It is
by no means certain that this custom had its origin in any suggestion
of cleanliness; on the contrary, it is fully as probable that the idea
was to avert the maleficence of witchcraft by putting out of sight
material the possession of which would give witches so much power
over the former owner.</p>

<p>Mr. John F. Mann confirms from personal observation that the natives
of Australia observed the injunction given to the Hebrews in Deuteronomy.
“From personal observation, I can state that the natives, all
over the country, as a rule, are particular in this matter, but it was
many years before I ascertained the reasons for this care. Sorcery
and witchcraft exist in every tribe; each tribe has its ‘Kooradgee’ or
medicine-man; the natives imagine that any death, accident, or pain, is
caused by the evil influence of some enemy. These ‘Kooradgees’ have
the power not only of inflicting pain, but of causing all kinds of trouble.
They are particular to always carry about with them, in a net bag, a
‘charm’ which is most ordinarily made of rock crystal, human excrement,
and kidney fat. If one of these medicine-men can obtain possession
of some of the excrement of his intended victim, or some of his
hair, in fact anything belonging to his person, it is the most easy thing
in the world to bewitch him.”—(Personal letter from John F. Mann,
Esq., Neutral Bay, New South Wales.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“The disposal of excreta is not so much for the sake of cleanliness
as to prevent any human substance from falling into the hands of an
enemy.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Schurig devotes a long paragraph to an exposition of the views
entertained by learned physicians in regard to the effects to be expected
from the deposition of the fecal matter upon plants that were
either noxious or beneficial to the human organism; in the former case,
the worst results were to be dreaded from sympathy; in the latter,
only the most salutary. Rustics, in his opinion, enjoyed better health
than the inhabitants of cities for the very peculiar reason that the
latter evacuated in latrines and in the act were compelled to inhale the
deleterious gases emanating from the foul deposits already accumulated;
whereas the countryman could go out to a comfortable place in the
fields and evacuate without the danger and inconvenience to which the
urban population were subject.</p>

<p>But he takes occasion to warn his readers that they must be careful
not to defecate upon certain malignant herbs which might be the
cause of virulent dysentery. “Præterea cavendum est ne feces supra
herbas malignas exulcerantes sive violenter purgantes deponamus hinc
enim causa latente dysenteria periculosa inducitur quæ vix nisi herbis
prorsus putrefactis ullis medicamentis cedit.”—(“Chylologia,” p. 792,
paragraph 66.)</p>

<p>Colonel Garrick Mallery, United States Army, reports having met
with people of respectability and intelligence in the mountainous parts
of Virginia who hold the same views upon the subject of latrines.</p>

<p>The Hon. John F. Finerty called public attention to the fact that
in the city of Mexico, ten years ago, beggars of the vilest caste invariably
made a practice of defecating upon the marble steps of the
main entrance to the grand cathedral.</p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Porter states that in some parts of the Mexican republic
the women come out in front of their doors to urinate; the author has
seen them doing this, and also defecating in the streets of Tucson, at
that time the capital of Arizona; he has seen the same practice in
several of the smaller hamlets of that territory and Sonora and New
Mexico, but always at night.</p>

<p>The Mexicans living on our side of the border never constructed
privies for their dwellings, a custom perhaps derived from Spain, where
we have seen that even in Madrid the construction of such conveniences
was unknown until after the middle of the last century.</p>

<h3>POSTURE IN URINATION.</h3>

<p>The Apache men in micturating always squat down, while the women,
on the contrary, always stand up. Giraldus Cambrensis says of the Irish:
“Præterea, viri in hac gente sedendo, mulieres stando, urinas emittunt.”—(“Opera,”
edited by James Dimock, and published under the direction
of the Master of the Rolls, London, 1867, vol. v. p. 172.)</p>

<p>The author has seen an Italian woman of the lower class urinating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
in this manner in the street near San Pietro in Vinculis, Rome, in open
daylight, in 1883.</p>

<p>French women were to be seen in the streets of Paris urinating while
standing over gutters.—(Mr. W. W. Rockhill.)</p>

<p>“Among the Turks, it is an heresy, to p—s standing.”—(Harington,
“Ajax,” in the chapter “Ulysses upon Ajax,” p. 43.)</p>

<p>The Egyptian “women stand up when they make water, but the men
sit down.”—(Herodotus, “Euterpe,” p. 35.)</p>

<p>Mr. Carl Lumholtz (author of “Among Cannibals,” New York, 1889)
also stated that the Australian men squatted while urinating; the
women generally stood erect, but upon this point he was not quite
sure.</p>

<p>“Mantegazza, in his ‘Gli amori degli uomini,’ describing the operation
of splitting the male urethra, practised among Australian tribes,
remarks: ‘To urinate, they squat down like our women, lifting the
penis slightly. It appears that, on the contrary, Australian women
urinate standing.’ (He is apparently quoting from Michluchs-Maclay.)
Among the Kaffirs, etc., at the Cape, the usual practice, I understand,
does not differ from ours.”—(Personal letter from Havelock Ellis, Esq.,
editor of the Contemporary Science series, dated Red Hill, Surrey, Oct. 8,
1889. From this gentleman there was also received much matter of a
most valuable character, from the early English dramatists, travellers,
and others, which has been already quoted from these sources direct.)</p>

<p>“It can be justly said that the inhabitants of Cadiack, if we except
the women during their monthly periods and their lying-in, have not
the least sense of cleanliness. They will not go a step out of the way
for the most necessary purposes of nature; and vessels are placed at
their very doors for the reception of the urinous fluid, which are resorted
to alike by both sexes.”—(Lisiansky, “Voyages,” p. 214, quoted
also in Bancroft’s “Native Races of the Pacific Slope,” vol. i. p. 81.)</p>

<p>Old women in Switzerland urinate standing, especially in cold
weather.—(Rev. Mr. Chatelain, himself a native of Switzerland, and
now a Protestant missionary in Angola, Western Africa.)</p>

<p>The men of Angola, Africa, urinate standing; the women of the
same tribes urinate standing, as a general thing, although there are
some exceptions. It should be remembered that the Jesuits have had
missions in that region for two hundred years, and some effect upon
the ideas of the people, due to these ministrations as well as to the
occupancy of the country by the Portuguese, should be perceptible.</p>

<p>In Ounalashka, the houses are divided by partitions. “Each partition

both for dyeing the grass and for washing the hands, but after cleansing
the latter in this manner, they rince them in pure water.”—(Sarytschew,
in “Phillip’s Voyages,” London, 1807, vol. vi. p. 72.)</p>

<p>Dr. Porter communicates the information that he has often heard
the Arctic explorer Dr. Hayes speak of the propensity of the Eskimo
of the east coast of Greenland to use the trench to the hut as a latrine.
He tried in vain to prevent this practice among his Eskimo attendants,
but believed that they had a pride among themselves in leaving conspicuous
traces of their presence.</p>

<p>For urinals among the Eskimo, see also notes from Egede, Egede
Saabye, and Richardson, under “Industries,” in this volume.</p>

<p>“Neither is it lawfull for any one to rise from the table to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
water; but for this purpose the daughter of the house, or another maid
or woman, attendeth always at the table, watchfull if any one beckon
to them; to him that beckoneth shee gives the chamber-pott under
the table with her owne hands; the rest in the meanwhile grunt like
swine least any noise bee heard. The water being poured out, hee
washeth the bason, and offereth his services to him that is willing;
and he is accounteth uncivill who abhorreth this fashion.”—(Dittmar
Bleecken’s “Voyage to Iceland and Greenland,” <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1565, in Purchas,
vol. i. pp. 636-647.)</p>

<p>Steller’s account shows that in his time the people of Kamtchatka
had no regular water-closets.</p>

<p>“The dogs steal food whenever they can, and even eat their straps.
In their presence no one is able to ease nature without the protection
of a club for the purpose of keeping them at a distance. As soon as
he leaves, the dogs rush to the spot, and under much snarling and
snapping each seeks to grasp the deposit.”—(Steller, translated by
Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>In the Eskimo myths there is the story of the Eskimo boy, an orphan,
who was abused by being made to carry out of the hut the large
urine vessel. This would indicate a certain antiquity for the employment
of these vessels.—(See “The Central Eskimo,” Franz Boas, in
“Sixth Annual Report,” Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, D. C.,
1888, p. 631.)</p>

<p>In the city of Bogota, Colombia, South America, the lower classes
urinate openly in the streets; in the city of Mexico, the same practice
prevailed until recently.</p>

<p>In “The Snake Dance of the Moquis of Arizona,” the author had
something to say touching the practice of the Moquis, Zuñis, and
others of the Pueblo tribes, of collecting urine in vessels of earthenware;
this was for the purpose of saving the fluid for use in dyeing the wool
of which their blankets and other garments were to be made. It was
noticed, however, that a particular place was assigned for such emergencies
as might arise when the ordinary receptacles might not be
within reach. Thus, in the town of Hualpi (on the eastern mesa in
the northeast corner of the Territory of Arizona), one of the corners
had been in such constant use, and for so long a time that the stream
percolating down from the wall had eroded a channel for itself in the
friable sandstone flooring, which would serve to demonstrate that the
place had been so dedicated for a very extended number of years.</p>

<p>Latrines of some sort would seem to have been in use among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
natives of Australia, if we are to interpret literally the expression employed
by A. Brough Smyth, which see under “Myths” in this volume.
The Tonga Islanders, in the mortuary ceremonies of their great chiefs,
are stated to have had them (see under “Mortuary Ceremonies” in
this volume).</p>

<p>Carl Lumholtz did not observe latrines of any kind among such of
the Australians as he visited.</p>

<p>Among the Chinese “it is usual for the princes, and even the people,
to make water standing. Persons of dignity, as well as the vice-kings,
and the principal officers, have gilded canes, a cubit long, which are
bored through, and these they use as often as they make water, standing
upright all the time; and by this means the tube carries the water
to a good distance from them.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> They are of opinion that all pains in
the kidneys, the strangury, and even the stone, are caused by making
water in a sitting posture; and that the reins cannot free themselves
absolutely of these humors but by standing to evacuate; and that thus
this posture contributes exceedingly to the preservation of health.”—(“The
Travels of Two Mahometans through India and China,” in
Pinkerton, vol. vii. p. 215.)</p>

<p>The Persian “must not pray before an overhanging wall, or in a
room where there is a pot de chambre.”—(Benjamin, “Persia,” London,

<p>In the Hawaiian Islands, if a man’s shadow fall on a chief, the man
is put to death.—(See “The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 190.)</p>

<p>“These natives (East Siberia) always preserve for use in their domesticity
the urine of the whole family; it is preserved in a large tub
or half-barrel, procured from the whale-ships or found in the drift that
comes upon their shores. They use the warm water from their bodies
for cleansing their bodies; the rim that gathers round the high-water
mark of their cess-pool is used for smearing their bodies to kill the
vermin.... The habits of these people are beastly in the extreme....
They seemed to have no aversion whatever to close contact with
the feces of men or animals.”—(Personal letter of Chief Engineer
Melville, U. S. Navy, to Captain Bourke.)</p>

<p>Van Stralenberg says of the “Koræiki” (Koraks): “For their necessary
occasions they make use of a tub, which they have with them
in the hut, and when full they carry it out, and make use of the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
tub to bring in water for other occasions.”—(“Histori-Geographical
Description of the North and East Parts of Europe and Asia,” p. 397.)</p>

<p>By referring to page 390 of this volume, it will be seen that the
Lapps, upon breaking camp, made it a point to burn the dung of their
reindeer in cases where any of these animals had died of disease; while
it is also related that immigrants to California from the States of Missouri
and Arkansas, for some reason not understood, had the singular
custom of burning their own excrement in the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“When they ease themselves, they commonly go in the morning unto
the Towne’s end, where there is a place purposely made for them, that
they may not bee seene, so also because men passing by should not be
molested with the smell thereof. They also esteeme it a bad thing that
men should ease themselves upon the ground, and therefore they make
houses which are borne up above the ground, wherein they ease themselves
upon the ground, and every time they do it they wipe; or else
they goe to the water’s side to ease themselves in the sand; and when
the Priuie houses are full, they set fire to them, and let them burn to
ashes; they pisse by jobs as dogs doe, and not all at one time.”—(Master
Richard Jobson, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1620, “Gold Coast of Africa,” in Purchas,

<span class="smaller">AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF THE RITES CONNECTED WITH THE WORSHIP OF BEL-PHEGOR.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Precisely what ceremonial observances the ritual of Bel-Phegor
demanded of the suppliant at his shrine is not likely ever to be
known. It would be worse than useless to attempt in a treatise of this
kind to affirm or deny the existence of the obscene usages alleged to
have formed part of his worship; sufficient, at this moment, to lay before
reflecting minds testimony on both sides of the question, with
reasons for the belief that flatulence could be presented as an oblation,
with examples of quaint customs which may partake of the
nature of “survivals” from religious ceremonies of a nature not far
removed from those supposed to have been associated with the rites of
Bel-Phegor.</p>

<p>Well has an old author remarked: “Men have lost their reason in
nothing so much as their religion, wherein stones and clouts make
martyrs; and since the religion of one seems madness to another, to
afford an account or rational of old rites requires no rigid reader.”—(Sir
Thomas Browne, “Religio Medici,” edition of Boston, 1868, p. 329,
article “Urn-Burial.”)</p>

<p>“Le Pet était une divinité des anciens Égyptiens; elle était la personnification
d’une fonction naturelle. On la figurait par un enfant accroupi
qui semble faire effort, et on peut en voir la représentation dans

Momus (voyez aux Polygraphes) donne, contre la page 19, deux figures

en a donné la preuve dans les éditions de son premier vol., et qu’il
en possédait une figure. (Voy. Menagiana, 1693, no. 397. St. Jerome
dit la même chose sur Isaie, xiii. 46. Voy. encore Klotz, act. littér. t.
v., première partie, 1, Elmenhorst sur l’Octavius de Minutius Felix;

<p>“Quelques antiquaires ont cru pouvoir identifier le dieu Crepitus des
Romains avec Bel-Phegor, Baal-Phegor ou Baal-Peor, dieu Syrien,—Phegor,
assure-t-on, ayant ce sens en Hebreu. (Origen contra Celsus;
Minutius Felix.) Mais, sur cette dernière divinité les savants sont fort
peu d’accord.</p>

<p>“Origène, St. Jerome, Salomon Ben Jarchi, lui donnent une signification
qui la rendrait tout à fait indigne de figurer dans notre catalogue;
mais Maimonide (Moge Nevoch, cap. 46) et Salom. Ben Jarchi (Comment.
3, sur Nomb. ch. 25) prétendent que son culte était plus sale que
obscène, et les traducteurs de ces rabbins pour exprimer le principal détail
des cérémonies célébrées en l’honneur du dieu de Syrie, disent:
‘Distendere coram eo foramen podicis et stercus offere.’</p>

<p>“Ajoutez que les pets étaient de bon augure chez les Grecs, de mauvais
augure chez les Romains.”—(Voy. Scaliger, Auson.)</p>

<p>“No one now supposes that the Rabbins had anything but their
imaginations to go on in what they say about Baal-Peor; they invented
the story as a fanciful etymology of the name.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>—(Personal letter

<p>Citations have already been made from the Bibliotheca Scatalogica,
a curious collection of learning, no name and no place of publication of
which can be found, but which seems to have been printed by Giraudet
et Jouaust, 315 Rue Saint Honoré, Paris, granting that this title be not
fictitious. In that work are to be seen the titles of no less than one
hundred and thirty-three treatises upon Flatulence, some grotesque,
some coarse, one or two of quaint erudition.</p>

<p>No. 88, entitled “Éloge du Pet, dissertation historique, anatomique
et philosophique sur son origine, son antiquité, ses vertus, sa figure,
les honneurs qu’on lui a rendus chez les peuples anciens, etc.; avec
une figure représentant le dieu Pet, et cette inscription: Crepitui ventris
conservatori deo propitio (p. 38),” the stupendous work of Sclopetarius,
No. 111, of the Bibliotheca (Frankfort, 1628) seems to have
been a monumental labor upon a subject not generally dissected.
The same remark may be applied to “Physiologia crepitus ventris”
of Rod. Goclenius, Frankfort and Leipsic, 1607, No. 123 of the
Bibliotheca.</p>

<p>The earliest known work upon this curious topic is “Le plaisant
deuis du Pet,” Paris, 1540.</p>

<p>“Origen saith the name Baal-Peor signifieth filthiness, but what
filthiness he knew not; Salomon Ben Jarchi writeth they offered to

<p>“The antient Pelusiéns, a people of lower Egypt, did (amongst
other whimsical, chimerical objects of veneration and worship) venerate
a Fart, which they worshipped under the symbol of a swelled paunch.”—(“A
View of the Levant,” Charles Perry, M. D., sm. fol., London,
1743, p. 419.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Time has preserved to us a figure of this ridiculous Divinity,
which represents a very young child in the posture of that indecent
action whence this god has his name.”—(Abbé Banier, “Mythology,”
English translation, 1740, vol. ii. pp. 52 <i>et seq.</i>)<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>“Their Beetle-gods out of their privies; yea, their Privies and
Farts had their unsavorie canonization and went for Egyptian deities....
So, Hierome derideth their dreadfull deitie, the Onion, and a
stinking Fart, Crepitus ventris inflati que Pelusiaco religio est, which
they worshipped at Pelusium.”—(Purchas, vol. v. p. 641.)</p>

<p>It may be well to bear in mind that the heathen idea of the power
of a god was entirely different from our own. The deities of the heathen
were restricted in their powers and functions; they were assigned
to the care of certain countries, districts, valleys, rivers, fountains, etc.
Not only that, they were capable of aiding only certain trades, professions,
etc. They were not able to cure all diseases, only particular
kinds, each god being a specialist; consequently, each was supposed
to take charge of a section of the human body. This was the case
with the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and others. In mediæval times
the same rule obtained, only in place of gods, we find saints assigned
to these functions. Brand, Pop. Antiq. vol. i. p. 356, <i>et seq.</i>, gives a
list of the saints, and the functions ascribed to each. On page 366 of
the work just cited, it will be seen that Saint Erasmus was in charge
of “the belly, with the entrayles.” Keeping this in view, we can
better understand the peculiar ceremonies connected with the worship
of Bel-Phegor; he was, no doubt, the deity to whom the devotee
resorted for the alleviation of ailments connected with the rectum and
belly, much as he would, at a later date in the history of religion,
have invoked Saint Phiacre to relieve him “of the phy or emeroids, of
those especially which grow in the fundament.” (See in Brand, loc.
cit. p. 362.) On the same principle that the worshipper was wont to
hang up in the temples of Esculapius wax and earthen representations
of the sore arms, legs, and other members which gave him pain, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
worshipper of Bel-Phegor would offer him the sacrifice of the flatulence
and excrement, testimonies of the good health for which gratitude was
due to the older deity.</p>

<p>“The Egyptians divided the human body into thirty-six parts, each
of which they believed to be under the particular government of one
of the decans or aerial demons who presided over the triple divisions
of the twelve signs; and we have the authority of Origen for saying
that when any part of the body was diseased, a cure was effected by
invoking the demon to whose province it belonged.”—(“Medical
Superstitions,” Pettigrew, Philadelphia, 1844, p. 47.)</p>

<p>The ascription of particular signs of the Zodiac to the care of
different members of the human anatomy is in line with the same
religious idea; because the signs of the Zodiac, especially the Animal
signs, were once Animal Gods.</p>

<p>Hone, in his “Every-Day Book,” has a therapeutical hagiology, too
long to be here repeated.</p>

<p>“Melton says, ‘The saints of the Romanists have usurped the place
of the Zodiacal constellations in their governance of the parts of man’s
body,’ and that ‘for every limb they have a saint.’” Thus Saint
“Erasmus rules the belly with the entrayles in the place of Libra and
Scorpius.”—(“Medical Superstitions,” Pettigrew, Philadelphia, 1844,
p. 54.) Next follows a long list of saints, with the particular functions
assigned to each, beginning first with the list to be found in Hone,
which Pettigrew extends.—(“Saint Giles and Saint Hyacinth against
Sterility,” idem, pp. 55, 56.)</p>

<p>“In later times, according to Herodotus, a particular and minute
division of labor characterized the Egyptians; the science of medicine
was distributed into different parts; every physician was for one disease,
not more; so that every place was full of physicians, for some
were doctors for the eyes, others for the head; some for the teeth,
others for the belly; and some for occult disorders. There were also
physicians for female disorders. The sons followed the professions of
their fathers, so that their numbers must necessarily have been very
great.”—(Idem, p. 44.)</p>

<p>As the Egyptian priests were the doctors of that country, it is perfectly
in accord with the eternal fitness of things that we should find
them, even after they had been differentiated into different professions,
restricted to the treatment of special diseases, much as the gods whom
the priests once represented had been restricted.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“The art of medicine is thus divided among them (Egyptians).
Each physician applies himself to one disease only and not more. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
places abound in physicians; some physicians are for the eyes, others
for the teeth, others for the parts about the belly, and others for internal
disorders.”—(Herodotus, “Euterpe,” p. 82.)</p>

<p>Hone shows that every joint of the fingers was dedicated to some
saint.—(See his “Every-Day Book,” vol. ii. p. 48.)</p>

<p>“But, under the venerated name of Hermes, were issued books of
astronomical forecasts of diseases, setting forth the evil influence of
malignant stars upon the unborn; telling how the right eye is under
the sun, the left under the moon, the hearing under Saturn, the brain
under Jupiter, the tongue and throat under Mercury, smelling and
tasting under Venus, the parts that have blood under Mars.... The
early centuries next after the Christian era produced a rank crop of
literary forgeries.”—(See “Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. iii. pp. 11, 12.)</p>

<p>“The New Zealanders gave a separate deity to each part of the
body.”—(“Folk-Medicine,” Black, p. 11.)</p>

<p>The interview between Moses and Jehovah, where the latter refused
to allow the prophet to see the glory of his face, but made him content
himself with a view of his posterior, indicates that the sacred writers of
the earlier periods were living in an atmosphere of thought which
accepted all such ideas as those surrounding the Bel-Phegorian
ceremonials.</p>

<p>The Hebrews believed that Jehovah should be propitiated with
sweet savors:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> “Offer up a sweet savor unto the Lord.” Bel-Phegor
and other deities of the gentiles, who were the gods of particular parts
of the human body, would, in all probability, be pleased with oblations
coming especially from that particular part; thus, the god of Hunting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
had offerings of game; the gods of the Seas had sacrifices of fish; babies
were offered to the deities of Childbirth; therefore the gods of the
fundament should, naturally, be regaled with excrement and flatulence.</p>

<p>Harington calls attention to David’s prophecy in the 77th Psalm:
“Percussit inimicos suos in posteriores, opprobrium sempiternum dedit
illis.” “He smote his enemies in the hinder parts and put them to a
perpetual shame.”—(“Ajax,” p. 25.)</p>

<p>The absence of unity is the characteristic of all primitive forms of
religious thought; hence, the various differentiations mentioned above
occur as a matter of religious necessity.</p>

<p>Among the practices prohibited by the Taoist religion: “A man
must not sing and dance on the last day of the moon.... Must not
weep, spit, or be guilty of other indecency towards the North.”—(Legge,
“Religions of China,” p. 187.)</p>

<p>The Parsis have a curious idea suggestive of the Hebrew antagonism
to the worship of Bel-Phegor: “14. The rule is that when one retains
a prayer inwardly and wind shall come from below, or wind shall
come from the mouth, it is all one.” (Shayast la Shayast, Max Müller’s
edition, Oxford, 1880, cp. x. verse 14, p. 221. A footnote explains:
“Literally, ‘both are one,’ that is, in either case the spell of the vag or
prayer is broken.”)</p>

<p>“The Bedawi, who eructates as a matter of civility, has a mortal
hatred to a crepitus ventris; and were a by-stander to laugh at its
accidental occurrence, he would be at once cut down as a ‘pundonor.’
The same is the custom among the Highlanders of Afghanistan. And
its artificial nature suggests direct derivation; for the two regions are
separated by a host of tribes, Persians and Beloch, who utterly ignore
the pundoner and behave like Europeans. The raids of the pre-Ishmaelitish
Arabs over the lands lying to the northeast of them are
almost forgotten; still, there are traces, and this may be one of them.”—(Burton,
“Arabian Nights,” vol. v. p. 137.)</p>

<p>According to Niebuhr, the voiding of wind is considered to be the
gravest indecency among the Arabs; some tribes make a perpetual butt
of the offender once guilty of such an infraction of decorum; the Belludjages,
upon the frontiers of Persia, expel the culprit from the tribe.
Yet Niebuhr himself relates that a sheik of the tribe “Montesids” once
had a contest of this kind among his henchmen, “avoit autorisé un défi
dans ce genre entre ses domestiques et couronné le vainqueur.” (Niebuhr,
“Description de l’Arabie,” Amsterdam, 1774, p. 27.) Snoring
and Flatulence would seem to have been considered equally offensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
by the Tartars. See Marco Polo’s reference to the mode of selecting
wives for the Grand Khan (in Purchas, vol. i. p. 82). He says that the
Grand Khan puts those deemed to be eligible under the care of “his
Barons’ wives,” “to see if they snore not in their sleepe, if in smell or
behaviour they bee not offensive.”</p>

<p>“Yet it is holden a shame with them to let a fart, at which they
wondered in the Hollanders, esteeming it a contempt.”—(“Negroes
of Guinea,” Purchas, vol. v. p. 718.)</p>

<p>On the Gold Coast of Africa, the negroes “are very careful not to
let a fart, if anybody be by them; they wonder at our Netherlanders
that use it so commonly, for they cannot abide that a man should fart
before them, esteeming it to be a great shame and contempt done unto
them.”—(Master Richard Jobson, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1620, in Purchas, vol. ii. p. 936.)
In the Russian sect of dissenters called the “Bezpopovtsi,” “during the
service of Holy Thursday, certain of them, known as ‘gapers’ or
‘yawners,’ sit for hours with their mouths wide open, waiting for ministering
angels to quench their spiritual thirst from invisible chalices.”—(Heard,
“Russian Church and Russian Dissent,” pp. 200, 201.)</p>

<p>Bastian, in “Allerlei aus Volks- und Menschenkunde” (vol. i. p. 9),
quotes from Kubary, “Religion of the Pelew Islands,” to the effect
that in cases of death, the vagina, urethra, rectum, nostrils, and all
other orifices of the body are tightly closed with the fibres of certain
roots or sponge, to prevent the escape of any of the liquids of the body,
which seem to be of some use to the spirit of the deceased.—(Contributed
in a Personal letter from Dr. Gatchett of the Bureau of Ethnology,
Washington, D. C.)</p>

<p>In Wallachia, “No mode of execution is more disgraceful than the
gallows. The reason alleged is that the soul of a man with a rope
round his neck, cannot escape from his mouth.”—(Maltebrun, “Universal
Geography,” Boston, 1847, vol. ii. p. 458, article “Hungary.”)</p>

<p>“The soul is commonly supposed to escape by the natural openings
of the body, especially the mouth and nostrils.”—(Frazer, “The Golden
Bough,” vol. i. p. 125.)</p>

<p>“Caton appliquait à l’objet d’un de nos chapitres; ‘Nullum mihi
vitium facit.’ ... C’est ce que disait Caton lorsqu’un de ses esclaves
pétoit en sa presence.”—(Bib. Scat., “Oratio pro Guano Humano,”
p. 21.)</p>

<p>In Angola, West Coast of Africa, flatulence is freely permitted
among the natives, but any license of this kind, taken while strangers
are in the vicinity, is regarded as a most deadly insult.—(“Muhongo,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>

Majesty, in all of which the latter came off second best. Melanchthon
is cited as describing one of these, in which there were results
worthy of incorporation in this work: “Hoc dicto victus Dæmon,

<p>Suetonius has the following remarks upon the Roman Emperor
Claudius: “It is said too that he intended to publish an edict ...
allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to any distension
occasioned by flatulence.” This was upon “hearing of a person
whose modesty, under such circumstances, had nearly cost him his
life.”—(“Claudius,” xxxii.)</p>

<p>Plutarch asks the question: “Question 95. Why was it ordained
that they that were to live chaste should abstain from pulse?... Or
rather was it because they should bring empty and slender bodies to
their purifications and expiations? For pulse are windy and cause a
great deal of excrements that require purging off. Or is it because
they excite lechery by reason of their flatulent and windy nature?”

<p>“The fact that in honor of the arrival of friends, the house is swept

For the same reason the Indian takes repeated baths before praying,

<span class="smaller">OBSCENE TENURES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In close connection with this worship of Bel-Phegor, if there ever
was such a worship, may be examined the obscene tenures by
which certain estates in England were held in “sergeantcy.” No less an
authority than Buckle, the historian, deemed an investigation of these
not beneath the dignity of his intellect, as may be ascertained by a
glance at his article “Contributions to the History of the Pet,” in his
“Commonplace Book,” p. 472. He refers to “Miscellanea Antica
Anglicana,” Blount’s “Ancient Tenures,” Luther’s “Table Talk” (as
above), Dulaure’s “Des Divinités Génératrices,” Niebuhr’s “Description
of Arabia,” Gifford’s edition of Ben Jonson, “The Staple of
News,” by Ben Jonson, Wright’s “Political Ballads,” in vols. iii. and
vii. of the Percy Society’s publications. With the exception of the
first named, all the above have been examined, and a transcription
made of the notes, which will be found inserted in their proper
place.</p>

<p>“The Lord of the Manor of Essington holds tenure from the lord of
the Manor of Hilton in this way. He, the first named, must bring a
goose each New Year to the hall of the Manor of Hilton, and drive it at
least three times around the fire, ‘while Jack of Hilton is blowing the
fire.’ This Jack of Hilton is an image of brass, of about twelve inches
high, kneeling on his left knee, and holding his right hand upon his
head, and his left upon pego, or his viretrum, erected, having a little
hole at the mouth, at which, being filled with water, and set to a
strong fire, which makes it evaporate like an aelopile, it vents itself in
constant blast, so strongly that it is very audible, and blows the fire
fiercely.”—(Blount, “Tenures of Land and Customs of Manors,”
Hazlitt’s edition, London, 1874, p. 118.)</p>

<p>This recalls the “mannikin” of Brussels, which may have superseded
some long since forgotten local deity; it still serves political
purposes occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Blount’s work was first issued under the title of “Jocular Tenures.”</p>

<p>The prevalence of phallic worship all over Flanders should be adverted
to in mentioning the “mannikin” of Brussels.</p>

<p>Dulaure (“Des différens Cultes,” Paris, 1825, vol. ii. p. 272 <i>et seq.</i>)
describes the phallic shrines of Saints Foutin, Guerlichon <i>et al.</i> “Anne
d’Autriche, épouse de Louis XIII., y alla en pélerinage,”—that is, to
the shrine of Saint Foutin.</p>

<p>He also shows that the use of the “raclure” of these phallic saints
prevailed in France until the opening years of the present century.</p>

<p>“Rowland, le Sarcere, holds one hundred and ten acres of land in
Hemington, County of Suffolk, by serjeantcy, for which on Christmas
Day, every year, before our sovereign lord the King of England, he
should perform altogether and at once a leap, a puff, and a fart.”—(Idem,
p. 154.)</p>

<p>“One Baldwin also formerly held these lands by the same service,
and was called by the nickname of Baldwin le Peteur, or Baldwin
the Farter.”—(Idem, p. 154.)</p>

<p>Dr. Fletcher, president of the Anthropological Society of Washington,
D. C., called attention to the fact that reference to the above
tenure of Baldwin, “per saltum, sufflatum, et pettum,” is given in the
Ingoldsby Legends, “The Spectre of Tappington,” based upon Blount.
Ducange, in his “Glossarium,” proves the antiquity of these tenures,
which go back, so far as known, to the earliest years of the fourteenth
century.—(See Ducange, article “Bombus.”)</p>

<p>Ducange also describes the peculiar custom governing the admission
of “filia communis” into the “villa Montis Lucii,” of which more
anon.</p>

<p>“Barrington, in his ‘Observations on the Statutes,’ speaking of the
people, says: ‘They were also, by the customs prevailing in particular
districts, subject to services not only of the most servile, but the most
ludicrous nature.’ ‘Utpote Die Nativitatis Domini coram eo saltare,
buccas cum sonitu inflare, et ventrum crepitum edere.’ (Struvii
Jurispr. Feud. p. 541.) Sir Richard Cox, in his ‘History of Ireland,’
likewise mentions some very ridiculous customs which continued in the
year 1565.”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. i. p. 515, article
“Fool-Plough and Sword-Dance.”)</p>

<p>“Monstrelet, en décrivant une fête que donna en 1453 le duc de
Bourgogne, dit qu’on y voyait: une pucelle qui, de sa mamelle, versait
hypocras en grande largesse; à côté de la pucelle était un jeune
enfant qui, de sa broquette, rendait eau rose.”—(Chroniq. vol. iii.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
fol. 55 v.; Dulaure, “Traité des Différens Cultes,” vol. i. p. 324, footnote.)</p>

<p>That these customs, absurd, obscene, irrational, as they appear in
the light of to-day, had their origin in the mists of antiquity is not at
all improbable; neither is it a violent assumption to attribute a religious
origin to them. It is conceded that they had all the force of
legalized customs; and law was anciently part and parcel of religion’s
dower.</p>

<p>The remarks of Ducange are inserted because they may not be
readily accessible to every reader. He quotes from Camden and
Spellman.</p>

<p>Baldwin “Qui tenuit terras in Comitatu Suffolciensi, per serjenciam
pro qua debuit facere, singulis annis (die Natali Domini), coram Domino
Rege, unum saltum, unum sufflatum, et unum bombulum.”</p>

<p>“Hemingston, wherein Baldwin le Petteur (observe the name) held
land by serjeantcy (thus an ancient book expresses it), for which he
was obliged every Christmas Day to perform before our lord the King
of England one saltus, one sufflatus, and one bumbulus; or as it is
read in another place, he held it by a saltus, a sufflus, and a pettus,—that
is (if I apprehend it aright), he was to dance, make a noise
with his cheeks, and let a fart. Such was the plain, jolly mirth of
those days.”—(Camden, “Brittania,” edition of London, 1753, vol. i.
p. 444.)</p>

<p>Grimm was impressed with the undeniable intermixture of the old
religious doctrine with the system of law; for the latter, “even after
the adoption of the new faith, would not part with certain old forms
and usages.” (“Teutonic Mythol.,” introduc. p. 12.) In another paragraph
he says: “I shall try elsewhere to show in detail how a good
deal in the gestures and attitudes prescribed for certain legal transactions
savors of priestly ceremony at sacrifice and prayer.”—(Idem,
vol. i. p. 92.)</p>

<p>Another odd usage of which no explanation has been transmitted
is thus described by Ducange, Dulaure, and others:—</p>

<p>“En outre, chaque fille publique qui se livre à quelque homme que
ce soit, lorsqu’elle entre pour la première fois dans la ville de Montlucon,
doit payer sur le pont de cette ville quatre deniers, ou y faire
un pet.”—(Dulaure, “des Divin. Générat.” p. 279, quoting from
Ducange, “Glossarium,” article “Bombus.”)</p>

<p>In a work by the Abbé Roubaud, entitled “La Pétérade, poême en
quatre chants,” we are informed, “Il renvoie à Ducange pour prouver
qu’en France on admettait les pets comme monnaie de cours en paiement
des péages.... Bombi pro scudis valebant.”—(“Bib. Scatalogica,”
p. 48.)</p>

<p>If we may believe Victor Hugo, the custom of the “péage” at the
bridge of Montluc was generally known to the people of France in
the fifteenth century. Thus, in the first chapter of “Notre Dame,”
the populace of Paris, at the Feast of Fools, are represented as indulging
in much badinage,—</p>

<p>“Dr. Claude Choart, are you seeking Marie la Giffards?”</p>

<p>“She’s in the Rue de Glatigny.”</p>

<p>“She’s paying her four deniers,—quatuor denarios.”</p>

<p>“Aut unum bumbum.”</p>

<p>Dulaure again quotes Ducange in regard to the tolls demanded of
public women first crossing the bridge at Montluc. He finds description
of this peculiar toll in registers dating back to 1398; he also
sees the resemblance between this toll and the tenure of the Manor of
Essington.—(See “Traité des Dif. Cultes,” vol. ii. p. 315, footnote.)</p>

<p>Surgeon Robert M. O’Reilly, U. S. Army, states that among the
Irish settlers who came to the United States in the closing hours of the
last century the expression was common, in speaking of Flatulence, to
term it “Sir-Reverence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“Sir-Reverence. In old writers, a common corruption of ‘save reverence,’
or ‘saving your reverence,’—an apologetic phrase used when
mentioning anything deemed improper or unseemly, and especially
a euphemism for <i>stercus humanum</i>.” “‘Cagada,’ a surreverence.”—(Stevens’s
“Sp. Dict.,” 1706.)</p>

<p>“Siege, stool, sir-reverence, excrement.”—(Bishop Wilkins’s “Essay
towards a Philosophical Language,” 1688, p. 241.)</p>

<h3>THE SACRED CHARACTER OF BRIDGE-BUILDING.</h3>

<p>It is quite within the bounds of argument and proof to show that
the Romans looked upon the building of a bridge as a sacred work.
Upon no other hypothesis can we make clear why their chief priest
was designated “the Greatest Bridge-Builder” (the Pontifex Maximus).
That this idea was transmitted to the barbarians who occupied Continental
and insular Europe would be a most plausible presumption,
even were historical evidence lacking.</p>

<p>Concerning the tolls exacted from the prostitutes who crossed certain
bridges in France, and the tenures by which certain estates were
held in England, we have to bear in mind that during the Middle Ages
bridges were erected by bodies or associations of bridge-builders, which
seem to have been secret societies. “It seems not improbable that
societies or lodges of bridge-builders existed at an early period, and
that they were relics of the policy of Roman times; but the history of
such societies is involved in obscurity. The Church appears to have
taken them up and encouraged them in the twelfth century, and then
they were endowed with a certain religious character.... The order
of bridge-builders at Avignon, with the peculiar love of punning which
characterized the Middle Ages, were called ‘fratres pontificales,’ and
sometimes ‘fratres pontis’ and ‘factores pontium.’ ... According to
Ducange (Gloss. v. fratres pontis), their dress was a white vest with a
sign of a bridge and cross of cloth on the breast.” (“Essays on
Archæological Subjects,” Thomas Wright, London, 1861, vol. ii. p. 137
<i>et seq.</i>, article “Mediæval Bridge-Builders.”) In this connection it
may be just as well to remember that the Pope of Rome is still the
Pontifex Maximus.</p>

<p>Knowing that bridges were constructed by secret societies, we
have fought out half our battle; for these secret societies were undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
under the patronage and protection of some god in heathen
times, or of some saint in later days, reserving for the honor of the
latter the same ritual which had been consecrated to the devotion of
the heathen predecessor.</p>

<p>The following from Fosbroke is pertinent: “Plutarch derives the
word ‘Pontifex’ from sacrifices made upon bridges,—a ceremony of
the highest antiquity. These priests are said to have been commissioned
to keep the bridges in repair, as an indispensable part of their office.
This custom no doubt gave birth to the chapel on London bridge, and
the offerings were of course for repairs.” In another place he mentions
“the annexation of chapels to almost all our bridges of note.”—(“Cyclopædia
of Antiquities,” London, 1843, vol. i. pp. 62, 146,
article “Bridges.”)</p>

<p>“Gottling (Gesch. d. Rom. Staatsv. p. 173) thinks that ‘Pontifex’
is only another form for ‘pompifex,’ which would characterize the
pontiffs only as the managers and conductors of public processions and
solemnities. But it seems far more probable that the word is formed
from <i>pons</i> and <i>facere</i>, ... and that consequently it signifies the priest
who offered sacrifices upon the bridge.”—(“Dictionary of Greek and
Roman Antiquities,” William Smith, LL. D., Boston, 1849, article
“Pontifex.”)</p>

<p>“Les Romains avaient réuni en collége sacerdotal leurs constructeurs
de ponts.”—(“Les Primitifs,” Elie Réclus, Paris, 1885, p. 116.)</p>

<p>Among the Romans—who were the great architects of the European
world, and whose aqueducts, baths, roads, and bridges have never
been approached in strength or beauty by those of any other nation
about them—it was to be expected that the title of the great priest
should be Pontifex Maximus, on the same principle that among the
Todas of the Nilgherris, who are pre-eminently a pastoral race, the
chief medicine man or priest is called Palal, “meaning the Great
Milker.”—(See for these statements “Les Primitifs,” Réclus, p. 260,
article “Les Monticules des Nilgherris.”)</p>

<p>The legends of the Middle Ages, all over Europe, from South Germany
to Scandinavia, are filled with references to bridges, mills, and
churches, but especially bridges, built by the Devil exclusively or by
his assistance; and in every case there is the suggestion of human
sacrifice having been offered.</p>

<p>“As a rule, the victims were captive enemies, purchased slaves or
great criminals.... Hence, in our own folk-tales, the first to cross
the bridge, the first to enter the new building or the country, pays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
with his life, which meant falls a sacrifice.... In folk-tales we find
traces of the immolation of children; they are killed as a cure for
leprosy, they are walled up in basements.... Extraordinary events
might demand the death of kings’ sons and daughters, nay, of kings
themselves.”—(“Teutonic Mythology,” Grimm, vol. i. p. 46.)</p>

<p>“When the Devil builds the bridge, he is either under compulsion
from men or is hunting for a soul; but he has to put up with the cock
or chamois, which is purposely made to run first across the new
bridge,” or “they make a wolf scamper through the door” of the new
church, or a goat.—(Idem, vol. iii. p. 102.)</p>

<p>“When the new bridge at Halle, finished in 1843, was building the
common people fancied a child was wanted to be walled into the foundations.”—(Idem,
vol. iii. p. 1142.)</p>

<p>“In modern Greece, when the foundation of a new building is being
laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram, or a lamb, and to let its
blood flow on the foundation-stone, under which the animal is afterwards
buried. The object of the sacrifice is to give strength and stability
to the building. But sometimes, instead of killing an animal,
the builder entices a man to the foundation-stone, secretly measures
his body or a part of it, or his shadow, and buries them under the
foundation-stone, or he lays the foundation-stone on the man’s shadow.
It is believed that the man will die within a year.”—(“The Golden
Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 144.)</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to carry this part of the discussion farther.
The curious may consult Grimm, who shows the frequency with which
human victims were walled up alive in new castles, ramparts, bridges,
and other structures. As time passed on and man grew wiser, there
was a substitution of a coffin as a symbol of the human victim; in
stables a calf or a lamb was buried alive under the main door, sometimes
a cock or a goat; under altars, a live lamb; in newly opened
graveyards, a live horse. All this testimony points conclusively to the
fact that every such structure was begun at least under auspices from
which all traces and suggestions of heathenism had not yet been eliminated;
consequently we shall not be very much in error in deciding
that there was some survival of a religious rite in the peculiar ceremony
insisted upon at crossing the bridge of Montluc, or that it, as all
others, was built by architects who still adhered to the old cultus, and
had influence enough with the rustic population to secure the incorporation
of certain features of a sacred character belonging to the
superseded ritual, and which have come down to us, or almost to us,
in a more or less mutilated and distorted condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>A very interesting article is to be found in “Mélusine,” Paris, May 5,
1888, which may be read with great profit at this moment; it is entitled
“Les Rites de la Construction,” and relates the popular tradition
of the failure to maintain a bridge at a place called Resporden, in
Cornwall, as each was swept away by flood almost as soon as completed.
The good people of the vicinity suspected sorcery and witchcraft,
and consulted a witch, whose directions were couched in these
terms: “Si les gens de Resporden veulent avoir un pont qui ne fasse
plus la culbute, ils devront enterrer vivant dans les fondations un petit
garçon de quatre ans.... On placera l’enfant dans une futaille défoncée,
tout nu, et il tiendra d’une main une chandelle bénite, de
l’autre un morceau de pain.”</p>

<p>An unnatural mother was found who gave her infant son for the
sacrifice, receiving some compensation, and the poor victim was walled
up alive as directed; the bridge was completed, and has since withstood
all the ravages of storm and freshet; but the tale still repeats the
last words of the hapless babe,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ma chandelle est morte, ma mère,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et de pain, il ne me reste miette.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The unnatural mother very properly went insane in a few days after
the sacrifice; and the wail of the abandoned babe is still to be heard
in the moaning of the winds and the sobs of the rains that fall upon
Resporden.</p>

<span class="smaller">OBSCENE SURVIVALS IN THE GAMES OF THE ENGLISH RUSTICS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The rough games of the English rustics are not altogether free from
vestiges of the same nature as have been recorded of the Arabian
sheik in preceding pages. For example, in Northumberland, England,
there was a curious diversion called “F⸺g for the pig.” Brand
gives no explanation of the custom, which may be allied to the jocular
tenures mentioned by Blount, and with them to the worship of Bel-Phegor.
Brand says: “The ancient grossièreté of our manners would
almost exceed belief. In the stage directions to old Moralites we
often find, ‘Here Satan letteth a f⸺.’”—(“Popular Antiquities,”
vol. ii. p. 9, article “Country Wakes.”)</p>

<p>In London itself such “survivals” lingered down to very recent
periods. “In former times the porters that plyed at Billingsgate
used civilly to entreat and desire every man that passed that way to
salute a post that stood there in a vacant place. If he refused to do
this, they forthwith laid hold of him, and by main force bouped his ⸺
against the post; but if he quietly submitted to kiss the same, and
paid down sixpence, then they gave him a name, and chose some one of
the gang for his godfather. I believe this was done in memory of
some old image that formerly stood there, perhaps of Belius or Belin.”—(Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. ii. p. 433, article “Kissing the
Post.”)</p>

<p>All these customs, absurd as they seem to us, may have been parts
of the ritual of deities of the same class as Bel-Phegor, who looked
after the excreta perhaps, and the organs connected therewith; some
kind of a tribute was demanded, and none could be more appropriate
than the offering of the parts or the submission to some pain inflicted
upon them by those in charge of the shrine.</p>

<p>Crossing the Atlantic, a custom suspiciously like the preceding,
was still to be heard of, as a rough boyish prank, in Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Penn., thirty or more years ago. Whenever it happened that any boy
was guilty of flatulence, all the party of school-boys would cry, “Touch
wood!” and run to touch the nearest tree-box; those who were slow in
doing this were pounded by the more rapid ones.</p>

<p>“Who the author alluded to should be I cannot say. In the collection

Fart censured in the Parliament House.’ It was occasioned by an escape
of that kind in the House of Commons. I have seen part of this
poem ascribed to an author in the time of Elizabeth, and possibly it
may be the thing referred to by Jonson.” (Whalley.) But Gifford,
from whose later editions I have drawn my material, comments to the
effect that “this escape, as Whalley calls it, took place in 1607, long
after the time of Elizabeth. The ballad is among the Harleian Manuscripts,
and is also printed in the State Poems; it contains about forty

manner (not without laughter), began to use a thousand jestures, turning
his eyes this way and then that way, seeming always as though
presently he would have begun to speake, and at last, fetching a deepe
sigh, with a grunt like a hogge, he let a beastly loud fart, and tould

</div>

<p>Care should be taken to distinguish between the religious use of
ordure and urine, and that in which they figure as outward signs
of mourning, induced by a frenzy of grief, or where they have been
utilized in the arts.</p>

<p>Lord Kingsborough (Mexican Antiquities, vol. viii. p. 237) briefly
outlines such ritualistic defilement in the Mortuary Ceremonies of
Hebrews and Aztecs, giving as references for the latter Diego Duran,
and for the former the prophet Zechariah, chap. iii.: “Now Joshua
was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel,” etc.</p>

<p>“The nearest relations cut their hair and blacken their faces, and
the old women put human excrement on their heads,—the sign of
the deepest mourning.”—(“The Native Tribes of South Australia,”
Adelaide, 1879, pp. 200, received through the kindness of the Royal

<span class="smaller">URINE AND ORDURE IN INDUSTRIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The economical value of human and animal excreta would seem to
have obtained recognition among all races from the earliest ages.
It is not venturing beyond limits to assert that a book could be written
upon this phase of the subject alone. It is not essential to incorporate
here all that could be compiled, but enough is submitted to substantiate
the statement just made, and to cover every line of inquiry.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be well to consider whether or not the constant
use of and familiarity with human urine and ordure in houses, arts,
and industries of various kinds would have a tendency to blunt the
sensibilities of rude races, so that in their rites we could look for the
introduction of these loathsome materials; just as we find that all
those races whose women are allowed to go naked place a very slight
value upon chastity.</p>

<p>“It certainly is not possible to separate the religious uses of urine
from its industrial and medical uses.... Probably nearly everywhere
it has been the first soap known. Does not this aspect of the matter
need to be insisted on, even from the religious point of view?... In
England and France, and probably elsewhere, the custom of washing
the hands in urine, with an idea of its softening and beautifying influence,
still subsists among ladies, and I have known those who constantly
made water on their hands with this idea.”—(Havelock Ellis,
“Contemporary Science Series,” London, Personal letter.)</p>

<h3>TANNING.</h3>

<p>The inhabitants of Kodiak employ urine in preparing the skins
of birds, according to Lisiansky.—(“Voyage round the World,”
London, 1814, p. 214.)</p>

<p>“Les gants, articles de grand luxe, et de haute élégance, faits pour
recouvrir de blanches mains et des bras dodus, sont imbibés d’un jaune<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
d’œuf largement additionné dudit liquide ambré.”—(“Les Primitifs,”
Réclus, p. 72.)</p>

<p>By the Eskimo urine is preserved for use in tanning skins,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> while
its employment in the preparation of leather, in both Europe and
America, is too well understood to require any reference to authorities.</p>

<p>The Kioways of the Great Plains soaked their buffalo hides in urine
to make them soft and flexible.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Urine is employed by the Tchuktchi of Siberia “in curing or tanning
skins.”—(“In the Lena Delta,” Melville, Boston, Mass., 1885, p. 318.)</p>

<p>Sauer says that the Yakuts tan deer and elk skins with cow-dung.—(“Expedition
to the North parts of Russia,” London, 1802, p. 131.)</p>

<p>Dung is used in tanning by the Bongo of the upper Nile region.—(See
Schweinfurth, “Heart of Africa,” London, 1878, vol. i. p. 134.)</p>

<p>Bernal Diaz, in his enumeration of the articles for sale in the
“tianguez” or market-places of Tenochtitlan, uses this expression:
“I must also mention human excrements, which were exposed for sale
in canoes lying in the canals near this square, which is used for the
tanning of leather; for, according to the assurances of the Mexicans,
it is impossible to tan well without it.”—(Bernal Diaz, “Conquest of
Mexico,” London, 1844, vol. i. p. 236.)</p>

<p>The same use of ordure in tanning bear-skins can be found among
the nomadic Apaches of Arizona, although, preferentially, they use the
ordure of the animal itself.</p>

<p>Gómara, who also tabulated the articles sold in the Mexican markets,
does not mention ordure in direct terms; his words are more
vague: “All these things which I speak of, with many that I do not
know, and others about which I keep silent, are sold in this market of

<p>Urine figures as the mordant for fixing the colors of blankets and
other woollen fabrics woven by the Navajoes of New Mexico, by the
Moquis of Arizona, by the Zuñis and other Pueblos of the Southwest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
by the Araucanians of Chili, by Mexicans, Peruvians, by some of the
tribes of Afghanistan, and other nations, by all of whom it is carefully
preserved.</p>

<h3>BLEACHING.</h3>

<p>“Roman fullers used human urine in their business, and Pliny says
it was noticed that they never suffered from gout.”—(Pliny, “Natural
History,” lib. xxviii. cap. 3: Bohn).</p>

<p>Urine has also been employed as a detergent in cleaning wool.—(Encyclopædia
Britannica, article “Bleaching.”)</p>

<h3>DYEING.</h3>

<p>Urine is used in dyeing by the people of Ounalashka, according to
Langsdorff, “Voyages” (vol. ii. p. 47); also, according to Sarytschew,
in “Philip’s Voyages” (vol. vi. p. 72).</p>

<p>The same use of it has been attributed to the Irish by Camden, in
“Brittania,” edition of London, 1753, vol. ii. p. 1419. His statement
is quoted by Buckle: “In 1562, O’Neal, with some of his companions,
came to London and astonished the citizens by their hair flowing in
locks on their shoulders, on which were yellow surplices, dyed with
saffron or stained with urine.”—(“Commonplace Book,” vol. ii.
p. 236.)</p>

<p>“As a substitute for alum, urine was employed.”—(“Folk-Lore of
the Pennsylvania Germans,” W. J. Hoffman, M. D., in “Journal of
American Folk-Lore,” 1889.)</p>

<p>“The preparation of blue, violet, and bluish-red coloring matters
from lichens by the action of the ammonia of stale urine, seems to
have been known at a very early period to the Mediterranean peoples,
and the existence, down almost to the present day, of such a knowledge
in the more remote parts of Ireland, Scotland, and Scandinavia,
renders it not improbable that the art of making such dyes was not
unknown to the northern nations of Europe also.”—(“The Manners
and Customs of the Ancient Irish,” Eugene O’Curry, introduction
by W. K. Sullivan, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, and New York, 1873,
p. 450.)</p>

<h3>PLASTER.</h3>

<p>As a plaster for the interior of dwellings, cow-dung has been used
with frequency; that the employment of the ordure of an animal held
sacred by so many peoples has a religious basis, is perhaps too much
to say, but it will be shown, further on, that different ordures were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
kept about houses to ensure good luck or to avert the maleficence
of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Marco Polo has the following: (In Malabar) “there are some
called Gaui, who eat such oxen as die of themselves, but may not kill
them, and daub over their houses with cow-dung.”—(Marco Polo, in
Pinkerton, vol. vii. p. 162.)</p>

<p>The huts in Senegal were plastered “with cow-dung, which stunk
abominably.”—(Adamson, “Voyage to Senegal,” in Pinkerton, vol.
xvi. p. 611.)</p>

<p>“The cow-dung basements around the tents” of the Mongols are
spoken of by Rev. James Gilmour.—(“Among the Mongols,” London,
1883, p. 176.)</p>

<p>“A floor is next made of soft tufa and cow-dung.”—(Livingston,
“Zambesi,” London, 1865, p. 293.)</p>

<p>Animal dung is used as a mortar by the inhabitants of Turkey in
Asia living in the valley of the Tigris.—(See “Assyrian Discoveries,”
George Smith, New York, 1876, p. 82.)</p>

<p>The natives of the White Nile, the tribes of the Bari, make
“a cement of ashes, cow-dung, and sand,” with which “they plaster
the floors and enclosures about their houses.”—(“The Albert Nyanza,”
Sir Samuel Baker, Philadelphia, 1869, p. 58. See the same
author for the Latookas, idem, p. 135; and for the statement that the
Obbos plaster enclosures, walls, and floors alike, see pp. 203, 262.)</p>

<p>Pliny tells us that the threshing-floors of the Roman farmers were
paved with cow-dung; in a footnote it is stated that the same rule
obtains in France to this day.—(Pliny, lib. lxxviii. cap. 71: Bohn).</p>

<p>Horse-dung was considered very valuable as a luting for chemical
stills and furnaces.—(See Schurig, “Chylologia,” p. 815; also, as a
“Digesting medium,” idem.)</p>

<p>Of the Yakuts of Siberia it is related: “In dirtiness they yield
to none; for a grave author assures us that the mortars which they
use for bruising their dried fish are made of cow-dung hardened by the
frost.”—(Maltebrun, “Universal Geography,” vol. i. p. 347.)</p>

<p>“The people of Jungeion ... collected the dung of cows and
sheep ... dried it, roasted it on the fire, and afterwards used it for a
bed.”—(Mungo Park, “Travels in Africa,” in Pinkerton, vol. xvi.
p. 834.)</p>

<p>“The vessels in which they (the Yakuts) stamp their dried fish,
Roots and Berries, are made of dried Oxen and Cow’s dung.”—(Van
Stralenberg, p. 382.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>The Index to the first volume of Purchas has “Dung bought by
sound of tabor, p. 270, 1. 40;” and “Dung of Birds, a strange report
of it;” but neither of these could be found in the main portion of
the volume.</p>

<h3>AS A CURE FOR TOBACCO.</h3>

<p>The best varieties of Tobacco coming from America were arranged
in bunches, tied to stakes, and suspended in privies, in order that the
fumes arising from the human ordure and urine might correct the corrupt
and noxious principles in the plant in the crude state.—(See
Schurig, “Chylologia,” p. 776. “Ex paxillo aliquandiu suspendere in
Cloacis Tabacum,” etc.)</p>

<p>“I heard lately from good authority that, in Havana, the female
urine is used in cigar-manufacturing as a good maceration.”—(Personal
letter from Dr. Gustav Jaeger, Stuttgart, August 29, 1888.)</p>

<h3>TO RESTORE THE ODOR OF MUSK AND THE COLOR OF CORAL.</h3>

<p>The odor of musk and the color of coral could be restored by suspending
them in a privy for a time.—(See Danielus Beckherius,
“Medicus Microcosmus,” London, 1600, p. 113.)</p>

<p>“Paracelsus scil. mediante digestione stercus humanum ad odorem
Moschi redigere voluit.”—(Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” Comment.
Ludovic. Lyons, 1690, vol. ii. pp. 171, 172.)</p>

<p>“Moschi odorem deperditum restitui posse, si in loco aliquo, ubi
urina et excrementa alvina putrescunt, detineatur, apud autores
legimus.”—(Schurig, “Chylologia,” p. 768.)</p>

<p>“Fit, ut Moschus longo tempore æmittat odorem, quem tamen
recuperat si irroretur cum pueri urina, vel si suspendatur in latrina
humana.”—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 276.)</p>

<h3>CHEESE MANUFACTURE.</h3>

<p>“A storekeeper in Berlin was punished some years ago for having
used the urine of young girls with a view to make his cheese richer
and more piquant. Notwithstanding, people went, bought and ate
his cheese with delight. What may be the cause of all these foolish
and mysterious things? In human urine is the Anthropin.”—(Personal
letter from Dr. Gustav Jaeger, Stuttgart, August 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>“En certaines fermes de Suisse on se sert, m-a-t’on-dit, de l’urine
pour activer la férmentation de certaines fromages qu’on y plonge.”—(Personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
letter from Dr. Bernard to Captain Bourke, dated Cannes,
France, July 7, 1888.)</p>

<p>Whether or not the use of human urine to ripen cheese originated in
the ancient practice of employing excrementitious matter to preserve
the products of the dairy from the maleficence of witches; or, on the
other hand, whether or not such an employment as an agent to defeat
the efforts of the witches be traceable to the fact that stale urine was
originally the active ferment to hasten the coagulation of the milk
would scarcely be worth discussion.</p>

<h3>OPIUM ADULTERATION.</h3>

<p>The smoker of opium little imagines that, in using his deadly drug,
he is often smoking an adulterated article, the adulterant being hen
manure; he is thus placed on a par with the American Indian smoking
the dried dung of the buffalo, and the African smoking that of the
antelope or the rhinoceros.</p>

<h3>EGG-HATCHING.</h3>

<p>In the description of the province of Quang-tong, it is stated that
the Chinese hatch eggs “in the Oven, or in Dung.”—(Du Halde,
“History of China,” London, 1741, vol. i. p. 238.) See the same
statement made in Purchas, vol. i. 270.</p>

<p>In China “their fish is chiefly nourished with the dung of Oxen that
greatly fatteth it.”—(Perera, in Purchas, vol. i. p. 205.)</p>

<h3>TAXES ON URINE.</h3>

<p>The Roman emperors imposed a tax and tolls upon urine because of
its usefulness in many things.—(“Dreck Apotheke,” Paullini, p. 8.
See previous statements in this volume and consult Suetonius “Vespasian.”)</p>

<h3>CHRYSOCOLLON.</h3>

<p>There was a cement for fixing the precious metals, which cement was
known as “Chrysocollon,” and was made with much ceremony from
the urine “of an innocent boy.” There are various descriptions, but
the following, while brief, contain all the material points.</p>

<p>Galen describes this Chrysocollon, or Gold-Glue, as prepared by some
physicians from the urine of a boy, who had to void it into a mortar
of red copper while a pestle of the same material was in motion, which
urine carefully exposed to the sun until it had acquired the thickness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
of honey, was considered capable of soldering gold and of curing obstinate
diseases: “Attamen medicamentum quod ex urina pueri conficetur
quod quidam vocant chrysocollon, quia eo ad auri glutinationem
utuntur, ad ulcera difficilia sanatu optimum esse assero fit autem id
figura phiali confecto mortario ex ære rubro habentem pistillum ejusdem
materiæ in quod mejente puero pistillum circumages, identidem, ut
non tantum a mortario deradedet, etc.” (“Opera Omnia,” Kuhn’s
edition, vol. xii. pp. 286, 287.)</p>

<p>Dioscorides describes the manufacture thus: “Quinetiam ex ea
(i. e. ‘pueri innocentis urina’) et ære cyprio idoneum ferruminando
glutea paratur.”—(“Materia Medica,” Kuhn’s edition, vol. i. p. 227
<i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>If a boy’s urine be rubbed up in a copper mortar with a copper pestle,
it makes a sort of mucilage which can be used to fasten articles of gold
together, as Sextus Placitus tells us: “Si pueri lotium cuprino mortario
et cuprino pistello contritum fuerit, aurum solidat.”—(“De
Medicamentis ex Animalibus,” edition of Lyons, 1537, pages not numbered,
article, “De Puello et Puella Virgine.”)</p>

<p>The definition given by Avicenna, the Arabian authority, is: “Quæ
fit ex urina infantium mota in mortario æro cum aceto in sole.”—(Vol.
i. p. 336, a 34 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>We also read of an “Alchymical Water,” called “Diana,” for transmuting
metals into gold and silver; it was believed that this preparation
was efficacious “ad mutandum Mercurium in Solem vel Lunam.”
(“Sol” was gold, “Luna” was silver; see notes from Paracelsus below.)
This “Diana” was employed in the preparation of “Crocus
Martis,” as well as in that of “Oleum Martis,” for giving metals the
color of gold, for polishing gold plate, for giving a fine temper to the
best iron or steel implements, and for making the “Chrysocolla” just
described.—(“Medicus Microcosmus,” Beckherius, pp. 103-108.)</p>

<p>Paracelsus, speaking of the metals says: “Sol, that is Gold; Luna,
that is silver; Venus, that is Copper; Mercury, that is Quicksilver;
Saturnus, that is Lead; Jupiter, that is Tinne; Mars, that is Iron.”—(“The
Secrets of Physicke,” English translation, London, 1633, p.
117.)</p>

<h3>FOR REMOVING INK STAINS.</h3>

<p>Human urine was considered efficacious in the removal of ink-spots.—(See
Pliny, Bohn, lib. v. and lib. xxviii.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<h3>AS AN ARTICLE OF JEWELRY.</h3>

<p>Fossilized excrement is used in the manufacture of jewelry, under
the name of “Coprolite.”</p>

<p>Lapland women carry a little case made from the bark of the birch
tree, “which they usually carry under the girdle” in which is to be
found reindeer dung, not as an amulet but to aid in weaning the young
reindeer by smearing the udders of the dams.—(See Leems’ “Account
of Danish Lapland,” in Pinkerton, vol. i. p. 405.)</p>

<p>But, from other sources, we have learned that the Laps attached the
most potent influences to ordure and urine believing that their reindeer
could be bewitched, that vessels could be hastened or retarded in
their course, etc., by the use of such materials. Several examples of
this belief are given in this volume; see under “Witchcraft.”</p>

<h3>TATTOOING.</h3>

<p>Langsdorff noticed that urine entered into the domestic economy of
the natives of Ounalashka. He tells us that the tattooing was performed
with “a sort of coal dust mixed with urine, rubbed in” the punctures
made in the skin (“Voyages,” vol. ii. p. 40). That the tattooing
with which savages decorate their bodies has a significance beyond a
simple personal ornamentation cannot be gainsaid, although the degree
of its degeneration from a primitive religious symbolism may now be
impossible to determine. Even if regarded in no other light than as a
means of clan-distinction, there is the suggestion of obsolete ceremonial,
because the separation into castes and gentes is in every case described
by the savages concerned as having been performed at the behest of some
one of their innumerable deities, who assigned to each clan its appropriate
“totem.” Clan marks may be represented in the tattooing, the
conventional signs of primitive races not having yet been sufficiently investigated;
for example, among the Apaches three marks radiating out
from a single stem represent a turkey, that being the form of the bird’s
foot. At the dances of the Indians of the pueblo of Santo Domingo,
on the Rio Grande, New Mexico, the bodily decorations were, in nearly
every case, associated with the clan “totem;” but this fact never
would have been suspected unless explained by one of the initiated.
In one of the dances of the Moquis the members of the Tejon or Badger
clan appeared with white stripes down their faces; that is one of
the marks of the badger, as they explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>The author does not wish to say much on this topic, since his attention
was not called to it until a comparatively late period in his investigations;
but he was surprised to learn that the Apaches, among whom
he then was, although marking themselves very slightly, almost invariably
made use of an emblemism of a sacred character; moreover,
it was very generally the work of some one of the “medicine men.”</p>

<p>The tattooing of the people of Otaheite seen by Cook was surmised
by him to have a religious significance, as it presented in many instances
“squares, circles, crescents, and ill-designed representations of
men and dogs.” (In Hawkesworth’s “Voyages,” London, 1773, vol. ii.
p. 190.) Every one of these people was tattooed upon reaching majority.
(Idem, p. 191.) It is stated that certain chiefs in New Zealand, unable
to write their names to a document presented to them for signature
drew lines like those tattooed upon their faces and noses.—(See
“Voyage of Adventure and Beagle,” London, 1839, vol. ii. p. 586.)</p>

<p>Among the Dyaks of Borneo “all the married women are tattooed
on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the thighs. The decoration
is one of the privileges of matrimony, and is not permitted to unmarried
girls.”—(“Head-Hunters of Borneo,” Carl Bock, London, 1881,
p. 67.)</p>

<p>A recent writer has the following to say on this subject: “The tattoo
marks make it possible to discover the remote connection between
clans; and this token has such a powerful influence upon the mind
that there is no feud between tribes which are tattooed in the same way.
The type of the marks must be referred to the animal kingdom; yet
we cannot discover any tradition or myth which relates to the custom.
There is no reason for asserting that there is any connection between
the tattoo marks and Totemism, although I am personally disposed to
think that this is sometimes the case. The tattooing, which usually
consists in the imitation of some animal forms, may lead to the worship
of such animals as religious objects.” (“The Primitive Family,”
C. N. Starcke, Ph. D., New York, 1889, p. 42.) Here is an example
of putting the cart before the horse; in all cases investigation will show
that the animal was a god, and for that reason was imprinted on the
person of the worshipper as a vow of supplication or prayer.</p>

<p>In another place the same writer says that tattooing had “to be
performed by a priest.”—(Idem, p. 241.)</p>

<p>The religious element in Totemism has been plainly revealed by W.
Robertson Smith in Encyclopædia Britannica, article “Sacrifice,” and
by James G. Frazer, M.A., in his “Totemism,” Edinburgh, 1887.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>Andrew Lang devotes several chapters to the subject (“Myth, Ritual,
and Religion,” London, 1887, vol. i. cap. 3). He says of the Australian
tribes: “There is some evidence that in certain tribes the wingong or
totem of each man is indicated by a tattooed representation of it upon
his flesh” (p. 65). On another page, quoting from Long’s “Voyages,”
1791, he says: “The ceremony of adoption was painful, beginning
with a feast of dog’s flesh, followed by a Turkish bath, and a prolonged
process of tattooing.”—(Idem, p. 71.)</p>

<p>A traveller of considerable intelligence comments in these terms
upon the bodily ornamentation of the Burmese:—</p>

<p>“Burmah is the land of the tattooed man.... In my visit to
the great prison here, which contains more than three thousand men,
I saw six thousand tattooed legs.... The origin of the custom I
have not been able to find out. It is here the Burmese sign of
manhood, and there is as much ceremony about it as there is about
the ear-piercing of girls which chronicles their entrance upon womanhood.
There are professional tattooers, who go about with books
of designs.... The people are superstitious about it; and certain
kinds of tattooing are supposed to ward off disease. One kind
wards off the snake-bite, and another prevents a man from drowning.”—(Frank
G. Carpenter, in the “Bee,” Omaha, Nebraska, May
19, 1889.)</p>

<p>Surgeon Corbusier, U. S. Army, says of the Apache-Yumas of Arizona
Territory, that “the married women are distinguished by seven narrow
blue lines running from the lower lip down to the chin....
Tattooing is practised by the women, rarely by the men.... A
young woman, when anxious to become a mother, tattooes the figure of
a child on her forehead.”—(In the “American Antiquarian,” November,
1886.)</p>

<p>The “sectarial marks” of the Hindus are possibly vestiges of a former
practice of tattooing. Coleman (“Mythology of the Hindus,”
London, 1832, p. 165) has a reference to them.</p>

<p>Squier, in his monograph upon “Manobosho,” in “American Historical
Review,” 1848, says that the Mandans have a myth in which
occurs the name of a god, “Tattooed Face.”</p>

<p>Alice Oatman stated distinctly that “she was tattooed by two of
their (Mojaves) physicians,” and “marked, not as they marked their
women, but as they marked their captives.” Be that as it may, the
four lines on her chin, as well as can be discerned from the indifferent
woodcut, are the same as can be seen upon the chins of Mojave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
women to-day.—(See Stratton’s “Captivity of the Oatman Girls,”
San Francisco, 1857, pp. 151, 152.)</p>

<p>Maltebrun says of the inhabitants of the Island of Formosa: “Their
skin is covered with indelible marks, representing trees, animals, and
flowers of grotesque forms.”—(“Universal Geography,” American
edition, Philadelphia, 1832, vol. ii. lib. 43, p. 79, article “China.”)</p>

<p>“The practice of marking the skin with the figures of animals,
flowers, or stars, which was in existence before the time of Mahomet,
has still left traces among the Bedouin women.”—(Idem, vol. i. lib. 30,
p. 395.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the Persian ladies, the same authority says: “They
stain their bodies with the figures of trees, birds, and beasts, sun, moon,
and stars.”—(Idem, vol. i. lib. 33, p. 428, article “Persia.”)</p>

<p>In the “Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London,”
vol. vi., it is stated that the “Oraon boys (India) are marked when
children on the arms by a rather severe process of puncturation, which
they consider it manly to endure.”</p>

<p>“Mojave girls, after they marry, tattoo the chin with vertical blue
lines.”—(Palmer, quoted by H. H. Bancroft in “Native Races,”
vol. i. p. 480.)</p>

<p>In the cannibal feast of the Tupis of the Amazon, Southey says, “The
chief of the clan scarified the arms of the Matador above the elbow,
so as to leave a permanent mark there; and this was the Star and
Garter of their ambition, the highest badge of honor. There were
some who cut gashes in their breast, arms, and thighs on these occasions,
and rubbed a black powder in, which left an indelible stain.”—(Quoted
by Herbert Spencer in “Descriptive Sociology.”)</p>

<p>“A savage man meets a savage maid. She does not speak his
language, nor he hers. How are they to know whether, according
to the marriage laws of their race, they are lawful mates for each
other? This important question is settled by an inspection of their
tattoo marks. If a Thlinkeet man, of the Swan stock, meets an
Iroquois maid, of the Swan stock, they cannot speak to each other,
and the ‘gesture language’ is cumbrous. But if both are tattooed
with the Swan, then the man knows that this daughter of the Swan
is not for him.... The case of the Thlinkeet man and the Iroquois
maid is extremely unlikely to occur, but I give it as an example of the
practical use among savages of representative art.”—(“Custom and
Myth,” Andrew Lang, New York, 1885, p. 292.)</p>

<p>“Tattooing is fetichistic in origin. Among all the tribes, almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
every Indian has the image of an animal tattooed on his breast or arm,
which can charm away an evil spirit or prevent harm to them.”—(Dorman,
“Primitive Superstition,” New York, 1881, p. 156.)</p>

<p>“The Eskimo wife has her face tattooed with lamp-black, and is
regarded as a matron in society.”—(“Schwatka’s Search,” William
H. Gilder, New York, 1881, p. 250.) “I never saw any attempt at
figure or animal drawing for personal ornamentation. The forms are
generally geometrical in design and symmetrical in arrangement....
None of the men are tattooed.”—(Idem, p. 251.)</p>

<p>“The Mojaves of the Rio Colorado tattoo, but the explanation of
the marks was exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory. The women,
upon attaining puberty, are tattooed upon the chin, and there seem to
be four different patterns followed, probably representing as many
different phratric or clan systems in former times.”—(See the author’s
article in the “Journal of American Folk-Lore,” Cambridge, Mass.,
July-September, 1888, entitled “Notes on the Cosmogony and Theogony
of the Mojaves.”)</p>

<p>Swan, in his notes upon the Indians of Cape Flattery, contents
himself with observing that their tattooing is performed with coal and
human urine.</p>

<p>“In order that the ghost may travel the ghost road in safety, it is
necessary for each Lakota during his life to be tattooed either in the
middle of the forehead or on the wrists. In that event, his spirit will
go directly to the ‘Many Lodges.’ ... An old woman sits in the
road, and she examines each ghost that passes. If she cannot find
the tattoo-marks on the forehead, wrists, or chin, the unhappy ghost
is pushed from a cloud or cliff, and falls to this world.”—(Dr. J.
Owen Dorsey, in the “Journal of American Folk-Lore,” April, 1889.)</p>

<p>Of the islands of the South Pacific, Kotzebue says, “I believe that
tattooing in these islands is a religious custom; at least, they refused
it to several of our gentlemen at Otdia, assuring them that it could
only be done in Egerup.”—(“Voyages,” vol. ii. pp. 113, 135,
London, 1821.)</p>

<p>“Tattooing is by no means confined to the Polynesians, but this
‘dermal art’ is certainly carried by them to an extent which is unequalled
by any other people.... It is practised by all classes....
By the vast number of them it is adopted simply as a personal ornament,
though there are some grounds for believing that the tattoo
may, in a few cases and to a small extent, be looked upon as a badge
of mourning or a memento of a departed friend. Like everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
else in Polynesia, its origin is related in a legend which credits its
invention to the gods, and says it was first practised by the children
of Tharoa, their principal deity. The sons of Tharoa and Apouvarou
were the gods of tattooing, and their images were kept in the temples
of those who practised the art as a profession, and to them petitions
are offered that the figures might be handsome, attract attention, and
otherwise accomplish the purpose for which they submitted themselves
to this painful operation.... To show any signs of suffering under
the operation is looked upon as disgraceful.”—(“World,” New York,
May 10, 1890, quoting from “The Peoples of the World.”)</p>

<p>“In the Tonga and Samoan Islands, the young men were all tattooed
upon reaching manhood; before this, they could not think of
marriage.... Tattooing is still kept up to some extent, and is a
regular profession.... There are two gods, patrons of tattooing,—Taema
and Tilfanga.”—(See Turner’s “Samoa.”)</p>

<p>“One of the features of the Initiation among the Port Lincoln
tribe was the tattooing of the young man and the conferring of a
new name upon him.”—(“The Native Tribes of South Australia,”
Adelaide, 1879, received through the kindness of the Royal Society,
New South Wales, T. B. Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>It is well to observe that each tribe in a given section has not only
its own pattern of tattooing, but its own ideas of the parts of the
person to which the tattooing should be applied. Thus, among the
Indians of the northwest coast of British Columbia, “Tattooings are
found on arms, breast, back, legs, and feet among the Haidas; on
arms and feet among the Tshimshian, Kwakiutl, and Bilqula; on
breast and arms among the Nootka; on the jaw among the coast
Salish women.”—(“Report on the Northwestern Tribes of Canada,”
Franz Boas, in “Trans. Brit. Assoc. Advancement of Science,” Newcastle-upon-Tyne
meeting, 1889, p. 12.)</p>

<p>Sullivan states that the custom of tattooing continued in England
and Ireland down to the seventh century; this was the tattooing with
woad.—(See his Introduction to O’Curry’s “Manners and Customs
of the Ancient Irish,” p. 455.)</p>

<p>The Inuits believe that “les femmes bien tatouées” are sure of
felicity in the world to come.—(See “Les Primitifs,” Réclus, Paris,
1885, p. 120.)</p>

<p>“Although the practice of the art is so ancient that we have
evidence of its existence in prehistoric times, and that the earliest
chronicles of our race contain references to it, yet the term itself is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
comparatively modern.... The universality as well as the great
antiquity of the custom has been shown by a French author, Ernest
Berchon, ‘Histoire Médicale du Tatouage,’ Paris, 1869, which begins
with a quotation from Leviticus xiv., which in the English version
reads thus: ‘Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the
dead, nor print any marks upon you.’ Don Calmet, in commenting
upon this passage, says that the Hebrew literally means ‘a writing of
spots.’ Many Italians have been tattooed at Loretto. Around this
famous shrine are seen professional tattooers, ‘Marcatori,’ who charge
from half to three quarters of a lire for producing a design commemorative
of the pilgrim’s visit to the shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. A
like profitable industry is pursued at Jerusalem.... Religion has
some influence (in the matter of tattooing) from its tendency to preserve
ancient customs. At Loretto and Jerusalem tattooing is almost
a sacred observance.”—(“Tattooing among Civilized People,” Dr.
Robert Fletcher, Anthropological Society, Washington, D. C., 1883,
pp. 4, 12, and 26.)</p>

<p>“Father Mathias G. says that in Oceania every royal or princely
family has a family of tattooers especially devoted to their service, and
that none other can be permitted to produce the necessary adornment.”—(Idem,
p. 24.)</p>

<p>“Tatowiren, Narbenzeichnen und Korperbemalen” (Tattooing, Cicatricial
Marking and Body Painting), by Wilhelm Joest, Berlin, 1887,
a superbly illustrated volume, has been reviewed by Surgeon Washington
Matthews, U. S. Army, in the “American Anthropologist,”
Washington, D. C., ending in these words, “The author’s opinion,
however, that ‘tattooing has nothing to do with the religion of savages,
but is only a sport or means of adornment, which, at most, has
connection with the attainment of maturity,’ is one which will not be
generally concurred in by those who have studied this practice as it
exists among our American savages.”</p>

<h3>AGRICULTURE.</h3>

<p>In the interior of China, travellers relate that copper receptacles
along the roadsides rescue from loss a fertilizer whose value is fully
recognized.</p>

<p>These copper receptacles recall the “Gastra,” of the Romans, already
referred to under the heading of “Latrines.”</p>

<p>“Les Chinois fument leurs terres autant que cela est en leur pouvoir;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
ils emploient à cet usage toutes sortes d’engrais, mais principalement
les excréments humains, qu’ils recueillent à cet effet avec grand
soin. On trouve dans les villes, dans les villages, et sur les routes, des
endroits faits exprès pour la commodité des passans, et dans les lieux
où il n’y a pas de semblables facilités, des hommes vont ramasser soir
et matin les ordures et les mettent dans des panniers à l’aide d’un croc
de fer à trois pointes.</p>

<p>“On traffique dans ce pays de ce qu’on rejette ailleurs avec horreur
et celui qui reçoit d’argent en France pour nettoyer une fosse, en donne
au contraire en Chine pour avoir la liberté d’en faire autant. Les excréments
sont portés dans de grands trous bien mastiqués, faits en pleine
campagne, dans lesquels on les délaye avec de l’eau et de l’urine et on
les répand dans les champs à mesure qu’on a besoin. On rencontre
souvent sur la rivière à Quanton des bateaux d’une forme particulière
destinés au transport de ces ordures et ce n’est pas sans surprise qu’on
en voit les conducteurs être aussi peu affectés qu’ils le paroissent de
l’odeur agréable d’une pareille marchandise.”—(“Voyage à Pekin,”
De Guignes, Paris, 1808, vol. iii. p. 322.)</p>

<p>“The dung of all animals is esteemed above any other kind of
manure. It often becomes an article of commerce in the shape of
small cakes, which are made by mixing it with a portion of loam and
earth, and then thoroughly drying them. These cakes are even
brought from Siam, and they also form an article of commerce between
the provinces. They are never applied dry, but are diluted with as
much animal water as can be procured.”—(“Chinese Repository,”
Canton, 1835, vol. iii. p. 124.)</p>

<p>“They even make sale of that which is sent privately to some distance
in Europe at midnight.” (Du Halde, “History of China,”
London, 1736, vol. ii. p. 126.) This statement of Father Du Halde
can be compared with what Bernal Diaz says of the markets of the
city of Mexico at the time of Cortés: “There are in every province a
great number of people who carry pails for this purpose; in some
places they go with their barks into the canals which run on the back
side of the houses, and fill them at almost every hour of the day.”—(Du
Halde, idem, p. 126.)</p>

<p>Rosinus Lentilius, in “Ephemeridum Physico-Medicorum,” Leipsig,
1694, states that the people of China and Java buy human ordure in
exchange for tobacco and nuts. This was probably on account of its
value in manuring their fields, which, he tells us (p. 170), was done
three times a year with human ordure. This leads him to make the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
reflection that man runs back to excrement,—“Unde stercus in alimentum
et hoc rursum in stercus.”</p>

<p>“The Japanese manure their fields with human ordure.”—(See Kemper’s
“History of Japan,” in Pinkerton, vol. vii. p. 698.)</p>

<p>“Yea, the dung of men is there sold, and not the worse merchandise,
that stink yielding sweet wealth to some who goe tabouring up and
down the streetes to signifie what they woulde buy. Two or three hundred
sayle are sometimes freighted with this lading in some Port of
the Sea; whence the fatted soyle yields three Haruests in a yeare.”—(Mendex
Pinto, “Account of China,” in Purchas, vol. i. p. 270.)</p>

<p>“Heaps of manure in every field, at proper distances, ready to be
scattered over the corn.”—(Turner, “Embassy to Tibet,” London,
1806, p. 62.)</p>

<p>The Persians used pigeon’s dung “to smoak their melons.”—(John
Matthews Eaton, “Treatise on Breeding Pigeons,” London, no date,
pp. 39, 40, quoting from Tavernier’s first volume of “Persian
Travels.”)</p>

<p>The finest variety of melon, “the sugar melon,” “cultivated with
the greatest care with the dung of pigeons kept for the purpose.”—(“Persia,”
Benjamin, London, 1877, p. 428.)</p>

<p>Fosbroke cites Tavernier as saying that the King of Persia draws a
greater revenue from “the dung than from the pigeons” belonging to
him in Ispahan. The Persians are said to live on melons during the
summer months, and “to use pigeons’ dung in raising them.”—(“Cyclopædia
of Antiquities,” vol. ii.)</p>

<p>Human manure was best for fields, according to Pliny (Nat. Hist.
lib. 17, cap. 9). Homer relates that King Laertes laid dung upon his
fields. Augeas was the first king among the Greeks so to use it, and
“Hercules divulged the practice thereof among the Italians.”—(Pliny,
idem, Holland’s translation.)</p>

<p>Urine was considered one of the best manures for vines. “Wounds
and incisions of trees are treated also with pigeon’s dung and swine
manure.... If pomegranates are acid, the roots of the tree are
cleared, and swine’s dung is applied to them; the result is that in the
first year the fruit will have a vinous flavor, but in the succeeding one
it will be sweet.... The pomegranates should be watered four times
a year with a mixture of human urine and water.... For the purpose
of preventing animals from doing mischief by browsing upon the
leaves, they should be sprinkled with cow-dung each time after rain.”—(Pliny,
lib. 17, cap. 47.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Schurig calls attention to the great value attached by farmers and
viticulturists to human ordure, either alone or mixed with that of animals,
in feeding hogs, in fertilizing fields, and in adding richness to
the soil in which vines grow. See “Chylologia,” p. 795.</p>

<p>In Germany and France, during the past century, farmers and
gardeners were generally careful of this fertilizer.</p>

<p>“In the valley of Cuzco, Peru, and, indeed, in almost all parts of
the Sierra, they used human manure for the maize crops, because
they said it was the best.”—(Garcillasso de la Vega, “Comentarios
Reales,” Clement C. Markham’s translation, in Hakluyt Society, vol.
xlv. p. 11.)</p>

<p>“Conocian tambien el uso de estercolar las tierras que ellos llamaban
Vunaltu.”—(“Historia Civil del Reyno de Chile,” Don Juan
Ignacio Molina, edition of Madrid, 1788, p. 15.)</p>

<p>Amelie Rives, in her story “Virginia of Virginia,” relates that a certain
family of Virginia was taken down with the typhoid fever on account
of “making fertilizer in the cellar.” We may infer that this
“fertilizer” was largely composed of manure. This is the interview
between Mr. Scott and Miss Virginia Herrick: “‘The tarryfied fever’s
a-ragin’ up ter Annesville,’ he announced presently. Virginia faced
about for the first time. ‘Is it?’ she asked; ‘who’s down?’
‘Nigh all of them Davises. The doctor says as how it’s ’count o’
their makin’ fertilizer in their cellar.’”—(In “Harper’s Magazine,”
New York, January, 1888, p. 223.)</p>

<p>Animal manure was known as a fertilizer to the Jews (2 Kings ix. 37;
Jeremiah viii. 2, ix. 22, xvi. 4, and xxv. 33). Human manure also.
(Consult McClintock and Strong’s Encyclopædia, article “Dung.”)</p>

<h3>URINE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SALT.</h3>

<p>Gómara explains that, mixed with palm-scrapings, human urine
served as salt to the Indians of Bogota,—“Hacen sal de raspaduras
de palma y orinas de hombre.”—(“Hist. de las Indias,” p. 202.)</p>

<p>Salt is made by the Latookas of the White Nile from the ashes of
goat’s dung.—(See “The Albert Nyanza,” Sir Samuel Baker, Philadelphia,
1869, p. 224.)</p>

<p>Pallas states that the Buriats of Siberia, in collecting salts from the
shores of certain lakes in their country, are careful as to the taste of
the same: “Ils n’emploient que ceux qui ont un goût d’Urine et d’alkali.”
(“Voyages,” Paris, 1793, vol. iv. p. 246.) This shows that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
they must once have used urine for salt, as so many other tribes have
done.</p>

<p>The Siberians gave human urine to their reindeer: “Nothing is so
acceptable to a reindeer as human urine, and I have even seen them run
to get it as occasion offered.”—(John Dundas Cochrane, “Pedestrian
Journey Through Siberian Tartary,” 1820-23, Philadelphia, 1824,
p. 235.)</p>

<p>Melville also relates that he saw the drivers urinate into the mouths
of their reindeer in the Lena Delta.—(Personal letter to Captain
Bourke.)</p>

<p>Here the intent was evident; the animals needed salt, and no other
method of obtaining it was feasible during the winter months. Cochrane
is speaking of the Tchuktchi; but he was also among Yakuts
and other tribes. He walked from St. Petersburg to Kamtschatka and
from point to point in Siberia for a total distance of over six thousand
miles. His pages are dark with censure of the filthy and disgusting
habits of the savage nomads, as, of the Yakuts, “Their stench and filth
are inconceivable.... The large tents (of the Tchuktchi) were disgustingly
dirty and offensive, exhibiting every species of grossness and
indelicacy.” Inside the tents men, women, and girls were absolutely
naked. “They drink only snow-water during the winter, to melt
which, when no wood can be had, very disgusting and dirty means are
resorted to,” etc. But nowhere does he speak of the drinking of human
urine, which, as has been learned from other sources, does obtain
among them.</p>

<p>(Tchuktchees of Siberia.) “It would be impossible, with decency,
to describe their habits, or explain how their very efforts towards
cleanliness make them all the more disgusting.... It requires considerable
habitude or terrible experience in the open air to find any
degree of comfort in such abodes. The Augean stables or the stump-tail
cow-sheds appear like Paradise in comparison.”—(“Ice-Pack and
Tundra,” Gilder, New York, 1883, p. 105.)</p>

<h3>PREPARATION OF SAL AMMONIAC, PHOSPHORUS, SOLUTION OF INDIGO.</h3>

<p>Diderot and D’Alembert say that the sal ammoniac of the ancients
was prepared with the urine of camels; that phosphorus, as then
manufactured in England, was made with human urine, as was also
saltpetre.—(Encyclopædia, Geneva, 1789, article “Urine.”)</p>

<p>Sal ammoniac derives its name from having been first made in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
vicinity of the temple of Jupiter Ammon; it would be of consequence
to us to know whether or not the priests of that temple had administered
urine in disease before they learned how to extract from it the
medicinal salt which has come down to our own times.</p>

<p>Schurig devotes a chapter to the medicinal preparations made from
human ordure. In every case the ordure had to be that of a youth
from twenty-five to thirty years old. This manner of preparing chemicals
from the human excreta, including phosphorus from urine, was
carried to such a pitch that some philosophers believed the philosopher’s
stone was to be found by mixing the salts obtained from human
urine with those obtained from human excrement.—(See “Chylologia,”
pp. 739-742.)</p>

<p>The method of obtaining sal ammoniac was not known to Pliny; he
knew of gum ammoniac, which he says distilled from a tree, called
metopia, growing in the sands near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, in
Ethiopia.—(Nat. Hist. lib. 12, cap. 22.)</p>

<p>“A notion has prevailed that sal ammoniac was made of the sand
on which camels had staled, and that a great number going to the
temple of Jupiter Ammon gave occasion for the name of ammoniac,
corrupted to armoniac. Whether it ever could be made by taking up
the sand and preparing it with fire, as they do the dung at present,
those who are best acquainted with the nature of these things will be
best able to judge. I was informed that it was made of the soot
which is caused by burning the dung of cows and other animals. The
hotter it is the better it produces; and for that reason the dung of
pigeons is the best; that of camels is also much esteemed.” (Here
follows a description of the method of distilling this soot.)—(Pocock’s
“Travels in Egypt,” in Pinkerton, vol. xv. p. 381.)</p>

<p>“Purifiée, l’Urine sert dans les arts pour dégraisser les laines, dissoudre
l’indigo, prépare le sel ammoniac.”—(Personal letter from
Prof. Frank Rede Fowke, South Kensington Museum, June 18,
1888.)</p>

<h3>MANURE EMPLOYED AS FUEL.</h3>

<p>The employment of manures as fuel for firing pottery among
Moquis, Zuñis, and other Pueblos, and for general heating in Thibet,
has been pointed out by the author in a former work. (“Snake
Dance of the Moquis,” London, 1884.) It was used for the same
purpose in Africa, according to Mungo Park. (“Travels,” etc., p. 119.)
The dung of the buffalo served the same purpose in the domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
economy of the Plains Indians. Camel dung is the fuel of the
Bedouins; that of men and animals alike was saved and dried by
the Syrians, Arabians, Egyptians, and people of West of England for
fuel. Egyptians heated their lime-kilns with it.—(McClintock and
Strong, “Dung.” See, also, Kitto’s Biblical Encyclopædia, article
“Dung.”)</p>

<p>Pocock says of camel dung: “In order to make fuel of it, they mix
it, if I mistake not, with chopped straw, and, I think, sometimes with
earth, and make it into cakes and dry it; and it is burnt by the
common people in Egypt; for the wood they burn at Cairo is very
dear, as it is brought from Asia Minor.”—(Pocock, in Pinkerton,
vol. xv. p. 381.)</p>

<p>Bruce does not allude to any of the filthy customs which are detailed
by Schweinfurth, Sir Samuel Baker, and others; he does say that
the Nuba of the villages called Daher, at the head of the White Nile,
Abyssinia, “never eat their meat raw as in Abyssinia; but with the
stalk of the dura or millet and the dung of camels they make ovens
under ground, in which they roast their hogs whole, in a very cleanly
and not disagreeable manner.”—(“Nile,” Dublin, 1791, vol. v. p.
172.)</p>

<p>“Argol, the dried dung of camels, is the common fuel of Mongolia.”—(“Among
the Mongols,” Rev. James Gilmour, London, 1883,
pp. 84, 146, 191, 296.)</p>

<p>The dung of camels is the fuel of the Kirghis.—(See “Oriental
and Western Siberia,” T. W. Atkinson, New York, 1865, pp. 218,
221.)</p>

<p>See also “From Paris to Pekin,” Meignan, London, 1885, pp. 186,

p. 151.</p>

<p>“Asses’ dung used for fuel and other purposes, such as making Joss
sticks.”—(Burton’s edition of the “Arabian Nights,” vol. ii. p. 149,

<p>Cow-dung fuel and sheep-dung fuel alluded to by Huc, as used in
Thibet.—(See also Manning, Bogle, and Della Penna, in Markham’s
“Thibet,” London, 1879, p. 70.)</p>

<p>Friar William de Rubruquis, the Minorite, sent as ambassador to
the Grand Khan of Tartary, by Saint Louis, King of France, in 1253,
speaks of eating “Unleavened bread baked in Oxe-Dung or Horse-dung”
(in Purchas, vol. i. p. 34). Cow dung used for the same purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
in Thibet.—(See Turner’s “Embassy to Thibet,” London, 1806,
p. 202.)</p>

<p>Yak manure used as fuel in Eastern Thibet, according to W. W.
Rockhill in “Border Land of China,” in “Century” Magazine, New
York, 1890.</p>

<p>Cow manure employed for the same purpose by the people of Turkey
in Asia, in the valley of the Tigris, near Mosul, according to George
Smith.—(“Assyrian Discoveries,” New York, 1876, p. 122.)</p>

<p>The “whole fuel” of the Mongols is “cow or horse dung dried in
the sun.”—(Father Gerbillon’s Account of Tartary, in Du Halde,
vol. iv. pp. 234, 270.)</p>

<p>The use of cow-dung as fuel in certain parts of the world would seem
not to be entirely divested of the religious idea.</p>

<p>“Firewood at Seringapatam is a dear article, and the fuel most commonly
used is cow-dung made up into cakes. This, indeed, is much
used in every part of India, especially by men of rank; as, from the
veneration paid the cow, it is considered as by far the most pure substance
that can be employed. Every herd of cattle, when at pasture,
is attended by women, and these often of high caste, who with their
hands gather up the dung and carry it home in baskets.</p>

<p>“They then form it into cakes, about half an inch thick, and nine
inches in diameter, and stick them on the walls to dry. So different
indeed are Hindu notions of cleanliness from ours that the walls of
their best houses are frequently bedaubed with these cakes; and every
morning numerous females, from all parts of the neighborhood, bring
for sale into Seringapatam baskets of this fuel. Many females who
carry large baskets of cow-dung on their heads are well-dressed and
elegantly formed girls.”—(“A Journey through Mysore,” Buchanan,
Pinkerton, vol. viii. p. 612.)</p>

<h3>SMUDGES.</h3>

<p>Dried ordure is generally used for smudges, to drive away insects;
the Indians of the Great Plains beyond the Missouri burned the
“chips” of the buffalo with this object.</p>

<p>The natives of the White Nile “make tumuli of dung which are
constantly on fire, fresh fuel being added constantly, to drive away the
mosquitoes.”—(“The Albert Nyanza,” Baker, p. 53.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“When they burn it (the dung of a camel) the smoke which proceeds
from it destroys Gnats and all kinds of vermin.”—(Chinese
recipes given in Du Halde’s “History of China,” vol. iv. p. 34.)</p>

<p>Schweinfurth describes the Shillooks of the west bank of the Nile as
“burning heaps of cow-dung to keep off the flies.”—(“Heart of
Africa,” vol. i. p. 16. See also “Central Africa,” Chaillé Long, New
York, 1877, p. 215.)</p>

<p>Such smudges were employed by the Arabians to kill bed-bugs.
“Effugatione Cimicum” effected by a “suffumigium” of “stercore
vaccino.”—(“Avicenna,” vol. ii. p. 214, a 47.)</p>

<p>Rev. James Gilmour describes a mode of extinguishing a burning
tent, observed among the Mongols, the counterpart of which is to be
found in “Gulliver’s Travels.”—(See “Among the Mongols,” p. 23.)</p>

<p>Lucius Cataline, accused by Marcus Cicero of raising a flame in the
city of Rome, “I believe it,” said he, “and, if I cannot extinguish it
with water, I will with urine.”—(Harington, “Ajax,” cap. “Ulysses
upon Ajax,” p. 22.)</p>

<h3>HUMAN AND ANIMAL EXCRETA TO PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF THE HAIR
AND ERADICATE DANDRUFF.</h3>

<p>For shampooing the hair, urine was the favorite medium among the
Eskimo.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Sahagun, gives in detail the formula of the preparation applied by
the Mexicans for the eradication of dandruff: “Cut the hair close to
the root, wash head well with urine, and afterward take amole (soap-weed)
and coixochitl leaves—the amole is the wormwood of this
country [in this Sahagun is mistaken]—and then the kernels of
aguacate ground up and mixed with the ashes already spoken of
(wood ashes from the fire-place), and then rub on black mud with a
quantity of the bark mentioned (mesquite).”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>A similar method of dressing the hair, but without urine, prevails
among the Indians along the Rio Colorado and in Sonora, Mexico.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
First, an application is made of a mixture of river mud (“blue mud,”
as it is called in Arizona) and pounded mesquite bark. After three
days this is removed, and the hair thoroughly washed with water in
which the saponaceous roots of the amole have been steeped. The
hair is dyed a rich blue-black, and remains soft, smooth, and glossy.</p>

<p>Dove-dung was also applied externally in the treatment of baldness.—(Hippocrates,
Kuhn, lib. 2, p. 854.)</p>

<p>The urine of the foal of an ass was supposed to thicken the hair.
(See Pliny, lib. xxviii. cap 11.) Camel’s dung, reduced to ashes and
mixed with oil, was said to curl and frizzle the hair (idem, lib. xxviii.
cap. 8). The natives of the Nile above Khartoum have “their hair
stained red by a plaster of ashes and cow’s urine.”—(“The Albert
Nyanza,” Sir Samuel Baker, p. 39.)</p>

<p>And the Shillooks of the west bank make “repeated applications of
clay, gum, or dung,” to their hair.—(“Heart of Africa,” Schweinfurth,
vol. i. p. 17; idem, the Nueirs, p. 32.)</p>

<p>“L’aqua ex stercore distillata fait pousser les cheveux” (Bib. Scat.
p. 29), while Schurig (Chylologia, p. 760) says that the same preparation
“promotes the growth of the hair and prevents its falling out.”</p>

<p>Schurig further says that swallow-dung was of conceded efficacy
as a hair-dye, and was applied frequently as an ointment. (Idem,
p. 817.) He recommends the use of mouse-dung for scald head and
dandruff, and even to excite the growth of the beard. (Idem, p. 823
<i>et seq.</i>) Ammonia, or, more properly speaking, “the ashes of hartshorn,
burnt and applied with wine,” was known to Pliny as a remedy
for dandruff. (Pliny, lib. xxviii. cap. 11.) Possibly the use of hartshorn
for this purpose sprang from the prior use of urine, from which
hartshorn or ammonia was gradually manufactured.</p>

<p>For loss of hair, the dung of pigeons, cats, rats, mice, geese, swallows,
rabbits, or goats, or human urine, applied externally, were highly
recommended by Paullini, in his “Dreck Apothek,” Frankfort, 1696.</p>

<p>Cat-dung was highly recommended by Sextus Placitus.</p>

<h3>AS A MEANS OF WASHING VESSELS.</h3>

<p>Among the Shillooks, “ashes, dung, and the urine of cows are the
indispensable requisites of the toilet. The item last named affects the
nose of the stranger rather unpleasantly when he makes use of any of
their milk vessels, as, according to a regular African habit, they are
washed with it, probably to compensate for a lack of salt.”—(“Heart
of Africa,” Schweinfurth, vol. i. p. 16.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“The Obbo natives are similar to the Bari in some of their habits.
I have had great difficulty in breaking my cow-keeper of his disgusting
custom of washing the milk-bowl with cow’s urine, and even mixing
some with the milk. He declares that unless he washes his hands
with such water before milking the cow will lose her milk. This filthy
custom is unaccountable.”—(“The Albert Nyanza,” Baker, p. 240.)</p>

<p>A personal letter from Chief Engineer Melville, U. S. Navy, states
that the natives of Eastern Siberia use urine “for cleansing their
culinary materials.”</p>

<p>By the tribes on Lake Albert Nyanza, the “butter was invariably
packed in a plantain leaf, but frequently the package was plastered
with cow-dung and clay.” (“The Albert Nyanza,” p. 363. See, also,
extract from Paullini, on p. 316, and from Schurig, p. 121, of this
volume.) There certainly seems to be a trace of superstition in the
first case mentioned by Sir Samuel Baker.</p>

<p>In the County Cork, Ireland, rusty tin dishes are scoured with cow
manure; the manure is blessed, and so will benefit the dishes and
bring good luck. It is a not infrequent custom to bury “keelars” and
other dishes for holding milk under a manure-heap during the winter
and early spring (when cows are apt to be dry, and the milk-dishes
empty), to protect them (the dishes) from persons evilly disposed, who
might cast a spell on them, and so bewitch either the cows or the milk.
Such an evil-eyed person could not harm a dish unless empty.</p>

<p>“The cow is believed to be a blessed animal, and hence the manure
is sacred.” (Personal letter from Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, Cambridge,
Mass.) This belief of the Celtic peasantry apparently connects itself
with the religious veneration in which the cow is held by the people
of India.</p>

<h3>FILTHY HABITS IN COOKING.</h3>

<p>The Eskimo relate stories of a people who preceded them in the
Polar regions called the Tornit. Of these predecessors, they say,
“Their way of preparing meat was disgusting, since they let it become
putrid, and placed it between the thigh and the belly to warm it.”—(“The
Central Eskimo,” Dr. Franz Boas, in Sixth Annual Report,
Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, D. C., 1888, p. 635.)</p>

<p>This recalls the similar method of the Tartars, who used to seat
themselves on their horses with their meat under them.</p>

<span class="smaller">URINE IN CEREMONIAL ABLUTIONS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Where urine is applied in bodily ablutions, the object sought is
undoubtedly the procuring of ammonia by oxidation, and in no
case of that kind is it sought to ascribe an association of religious
ideas. But where the ablutions are attended with ceremonial observances,
are incorporated in a ritual, or take place in chambers reserved
for sacred purposes, it is not unfair to suggest that everything made
use of, including the urine, has a sacred or a semi-sacred significance.</p>

<p>No difficulty is experienced in assigning to their proper categories
the urinal ablutions of the Eskimo of Greenland (Hans Egede Saabye,
p. 256); of the Alaskans (Sabytschew, in Phillips, vol. vi.); of the
Indians of the northwest coast of America (Whymper’s “Alaska,”
London, 1868, p. 142; H. H. Bancroft, “Nat. Races,” vol. i. p. 83);
of the Indians of Cape Flattery (Swan, in “Smithsonian Contrib.”);
of the people of Iceland (see below); of Siberia (see below); and of
the savages of Lower California.</p>

<p>Pericuis of Lower California. “Mothers, to protect them against
the weather, cover the entire bodies of their children with a varnish
of coal and urine.”—(Bancroft, vol. i. p. 559.)</p>

<p>Clavigero not only tells all that Bancroft does, but he adds that the
women of California washed their own faces in urine.—(“Hist. de
Baja California,” Mexico, 1852, p. 28; see, also, Orozco y Berra and
Baegert.)</p>

<p>“People of Iceland are reported to wash their faces and hands in
pisse.” (Hakluyt, “Voyages,” vol. i. p. 664.) This report was, however,
indignantly denied of all but the common people by Arugrianus
Jonas, an Icelandic writer.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Ounalashka “wash themselves first with their
own urine, and afterwards with water.”—(“Russian Discoveries,”
William Coxe, London, 1803, quoting Solovoof’s “Voyage,” 1764,
p. 226.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>In the same volume is to be found the statement that in Alaska and
the Fox Islands, the people “washed themselves, according to custom,
first with urine, and then with water.”—(p. 225, quoting “Voyage of
Captain Krenitzin,” 1768.)</p>

<p>When a child gets very dirty “with soot and grease,” a Vancouver
squaw uses “stale urine” to cleanse it. “This species of alkali as a
substitute for soap is the general accompaniment of the morning
toilet of both sexes, male and female. During winter they periodically
scrub themselves with sand and urine.”—(J. G. Swan, “Indians of
Cape Flattery, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” No. 220,
p. 19.)</p>

<p>Among the Tchuktchees, urine “is a useful article in their household
economy, being preserved in a special vessel, and employed as a
soap or lye for cleansing bodies or clothing.”—(“In the Lena Delta,”
Melville, p. 318.)</p>

<p>“But they also wash themselves, as well as their clothes, with it;
and even in the hot bath, of which men and women are alike fond,
because they love to perspire, it is with this fluid they sometimes make
their ablutions.”—(Lisiansky, “Voyage round the World,” London,
1811, p. 214.)</p>

<p>Used as “a substitute for soap-lees, according to Langsdorff.”—(“Voyages,”
London, 1814, vol. ii. p. 47.)</p>

<p>“By night, the Master of the house, with all his family, his wife
and children, lye in one room.... All of them make water in one
chamber-pot, with which, in the morning, they wash their face, mouth,
teeth, and hands. They allege many reasons thereof, to wit, that it
makes a faire face, maintaineth the strength, confirmeth the sinewes in
the hands, and preserveth the teeth from putrefaction.”—(“Dittmar
Bleekens,” in Purchas, vol. i. p. 647.)</p>

<p>After describing the double tent of skins used by the Tchuktchees,
Mr. W. H. Gilder, author of “Schwatka’s Search,” says all food is
served in the “yoronger,” or inner tent, in which men and women sit,
in a state of nudity, wearing only a small loin-cloth of seal-skin.</p>

<p>After finishing the meal, “a small, shallow pail or pan of wood is
passed to any one who feels so inclined, to furnish the warm urine with
which the board and knife are washed by the housewife. It is a matter
of indifference who furnishes the fluid, whether the men, women, or
children; and I have myself frequently supplied the landlady with the
dish-water. In nearly every tent there is kept from the summer season
a small supply of dried grass. A little bunch of this is dipped in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
warm urine and serves as a dish-rag and a napkin. These people are
generally kind and hospitable, and were very attentive to my wants as
a stranger, and regarded by them as more helpless than a native.
The women would, therefore, often turn to me after washing the board
and knife, and wash my fingers and wipe the grease from my mouth
with the moistened grass. Any of the men or women in the tent
who desired it would also ask for the wet grass, and use it in the same
way.</p>

<p>“It was not done as a ceremony, but merely as a matter of course
or of necessity.</p>

<p>“I do not think they would use urine for such purposes if they
could get all the water, and especially the warm water, they needed.
But all the water they have in winter is obtained by melting snow or
ice over an oil lamp,—a very slow process; and the supply is therefore
very limited, being scarcely more than is required for drinking
purposes, or to boil such fresh meat as they may have.</p>

<p>“The urine, being warm and containing a small quantity of ammonia,
is particularly well adapted for removing grease from the board
and utensils, which would otherwise soon become foul, and to their
taste much more disagreeable.</p>

<p>“The bottom of the ‘yoronger’ is generally carpeted with tanned
seal-skins, and they too are frequently washed with the same fluid.
The consequence is that there is ever a mingled odor of ammonia and
rotten walrus-meat pervading a well-supplied and thrifty Tchouktchi
dwelling.”—(Personal letter to Captain Bourke, dated New York,
October 15, 1889.)</p>

<p>“Vice-Admiral of the Narrow Seas.” “A drunken man that pisses
under the table into his companion’s shoes.”—(Grose, “Dictionary of
Buckish Slang,” London, 1811, article as above.)</p>

<p>This use of urine as a tooth-wash has had a very extensive diffusion;
it is still to be found in many parts of Europe and America, of boasted
enlightenment. The Celtiberii of Spain, “although they boasted of
cleanliness both in their nourishment and in their dress, it was not
unusual for them to wash their teeth and bodies in urine,—a custom
which they considered favorable to health.”—(Maltebrun, “Univ.
Geog.,” vol. v. book 137, p. 357, article “Spain.”)</p>

<p>From Strabo we learn that the Iberians “do not attend to ease or
luxury, unless any one considers it can add to the happiness of their
lives to wash themselves and their wives in stale urine kept in tanks,
and to rinse their teeth with it, which they say is the custom both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
with the Cantabrians and their neighbors.” (Strabo, “Geography,”
Bohn, lib. iii. cap. 4, par. 16, London, 1854. In a footnote it is
stated that “Apuleius, Catullus, and Diodorus Siculus all speak of
this singular custom.”) The same practice is alluded to by Percy, and
also by the “Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire Raisonné des Sciences,”
Neufchatel, 1745, vol. xvii. p. 499; and the practice is said to obtain
among the modern Spaniards as well. “Les Espagnols font grand
usage de l’urine pour se nettoyer les dents. Les anciens Celtibériens
faisoient la même chose.”—(Received from Prof. Frank Rede Fowke,
London, June 18, 1888.)</p>

<p>“Bien que soigneux de leurs personnes et propres dans leur manière
de vivre, les Celtibères se lavent tout le corps d’urine, s’en frottant
même les dents, estimant cela un bon moyen pour entretenir la santé
du corps.”—(Diodore, v. 33.)</p>

<p>The manners of the Celtiberians, as described by Strabo and others,
have come down through many generations to their descendants in all
parts of the world; all that he related of the use of human urine as a
mouth-wash, as a means of ablution, and as a dentifrice, was transplanted
to the shores of America by the Spanish colonists; and even
in the present generation, according to Gen. S. V. Bénèt, U. S. Army,
traces of such customs were to be found among some of the settlers in
Florida.</p>

<p>The same custom has been observed among the natives along the
Upper Nile. “The Obbo natives wash out their mouths with their
own urine. This habit may have originated in the total absence of
salt in their country.”—(“The Albert Nyanza,” Sir Samuel Baker,
p. 240.)</p>

<p>In England likewise there was a former employment of the same
fluid as a dentifrice.</p>

<p>“‘Nettoyer ses dents avec de l’urine, mode espagnole,’ dit Erasme.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” Elie Réclus, Paris, 1885, quoting Erasmus, “De
Civilitate.”)</p>

<p>Urine was employed as a tooth-wash, alone or mixed with orris
powder. “Farina orobi (bitter vetch) permisceatur cum urina.”—(“Medicus
Microcosmus,” Danielus Beckherius, pp. 62-64.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>A paragraph in Paullini’s “Dreck Apothek,” p. 74, would show
that in Germany the same usages were not unknown. As a dentifrice
he recommends urine as a wash; or a powder made of pulverized gravel
stone, mixed with urine.</p>

<p>Ivan Petroff states that the peasants of Portugal still wash their
clothes in urine.—(Ivan Petroff, in “Trans. American Anthropological
Society,” 1882, vol. i.)</p>

<p>Urine is used on whaling vessels, when stale, for washing flannel
shirts, which are then thrown overboard and towed after the ship.—(Dr.
J. H. Porter.)</p>

<p>Dr. V. T. McGillicuddy, of Rapid City, Dakota, furnishes the information
that Irish, German, and Scandinavian washerwomen who have
immigrated to the United States persist in adding human urine to the
water to be used for cleansing blankets.</p>

<p>“I have observed somewhere that the Basks and some Hindus
clean their mouths with urine, but I do not remember the book.”—(Dr.
Alfred Gatchett, Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, D. C.)</p>

<p>Dr. Carl Lumholtz, of Christiania, Norway, states that he had seen
the savages of Herbert River, Australia, in 18° south latitude, with
whom he lived for some months, use their own urine to clean their
hands after they had been gathering wild honey.</p>

<p>The statement concerning the Celtiberians may also be found in
Clavigero.—(“Hist. de Baja California,” p. 28, quoting Diodorus
Siculus.)</p>

<p>Diderot and D’Alembert assert unequivocally that in the latter
years of the last century the people of the Spanish Peninsula still used
urine as a dentifrice.—(“Les Espagnols,” etc., reading as above given
from “Dict. Raisonné.” See Encyclopédie, Geneva, 1789, article
“Urine.”)</p>

</div>

<p>But in the examples adduced from Whymper concerning the people
of the village of Unlacheet, on Norton Sound, “the <i>dancers</i> of
the Malemutes of Norton Sound bathed themselves in urine.” (Whymper’s
“Alaska,” London, 1868, pp. 142, 152.) Although, on another
page, Whymper says that this was for want of soap, doubt may, with
some reason, be entertained. Bathing is a frequent accompaniment,
an integral part of the religious ceremonial among all the Indians of
America, and no doubt among the Inuit or Eskimo as well; when this
is performed by dancers, there is further reason to examine carefully
for a religious complication, and especially if these dances be celebrated
in sacred places, as Petroff relates they are.</p>

<p>“They never bathe or wash their bodies, but on certain occasions
the men light a fire in the kashima, strip themselves, and dance and
jump around until in a profuse perspiration. They then apply urine to
their oily bodies and rub themselves until a lather appears, after which
they plunge into the river.”—(Ivan Petroff in “Transactions American
Anthropological Society,” vol. i. 1882.)</p>

<p>“In each village of the Kuskutchewak (of Alaska) there is a public
building named the kashim, in which councils are held and festivals
kept, and which must be large enough to contain all the grown men
of the village. It has raised platforms around the walls, and a place
in the centre for a fire, with an aperture in the roof for the admission
of light.”—(Richardson, “Arctic Searching Expedition,” London,
1851, p. 365.)</p>

<p>Those kashima are identical with the estufas of Zuñis, Moquis, and
Rio Grande Pueblos. Whymper himself describes them thus: “These
buildings may be regarded as the natives’ town hall; orations are made,
festivals and feasts are held in them.”</p>

<p>No room is left for doubt after reading the fuller description of these
kashima, contained in Bancroft. He says the Eskimo dance in them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
“often <i>in puris naturalibus</i>,” and make “burlesque imitations of birds
and beasts.” Dog or wolf tails hang to the rear of their garments. A
sacred feast of fish and berries accompanies these dances, wherein the
actors “elevate the provisions successively to the four cardinal points,
and once to the skies above, when all partake of the feast.”—(Bancroft,
“Native Races,” vol. i. p. 78.)</p>

<p>There is a description of one of these dances by an American, Mr.
W. H. Gilder, an eyewitness. “The kashine (<i>sic</i>) is a sort of town
hall for the male members of the tribe.... It is built almost entirely
under ground, and with a roof deeply covered with earth. It is
lighted through a skylight in the roof, and entered by a passage-way
and an opening which can only be passed by crawling on hands and
knees.... In the centre of the room is a deep pit, where in winter a
fire is built to heat the building, after which it is closed, and the
heat retained for an entire day. In this building the men live almost
all the time. Here they sleep and eat, and they seldom rest in the
bosom of their families.” He further says that there was “a shelf
which extends all round the room against the wall.... One young
man prepared himself for the dance by stripping off all his clothing,
except his trousers, and putting on a pair of reindeer mittens....
The dance had more of the character of Indian performances than any
I had ever previously seen among the Esquimaux.”—(“Ice-Pack and
Tundra,” pp. 56-58.)</p>

<p>The following information received from Victor Namoff, a Kadiak of
mixed blood, relates to a ceremonial dance which he observed among the
Aiga-lukamut Eskimo of the southern coast of Alaska. The informant,
as his father had been before him, had for a number of years been employed
by the Russians to visit the various tribes on the mainland to
conduct trade for the collection of furs and peltries. Besides being
perfectly familiar with the English and Russian languages, he had acquired
considerable familiarity with quite a number of native dialects,
and was thus enabled to mingle with the various peoples among whom
much of his time was spent. The ceremony was conducted in a large
partly underground chamber, of oblong shape, having a continuous
platform or shelf, constructed so as to be used either as seats or for
sleeping. The only light obtained was from native oil lamps. The
participants, numbering about ten dozen, were entirely naked, and
after being seated a short time several natives, detailed as musicians,
began to sing. Then one of the natives arose, and performed the disgusting
operation of urinating over the back and shoulders of the person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
seated next him, after which he jumped down upon the ground,
and began to dance, keeping time with the music. The one who had
been subjected to the operation just mentioned, then subjected his
nearest neighbor to a similar douche, and he in turn the next in
order, and so on until the last person on the bench had been similarly
dealt with, he in turn being obliged to accommodate the initiator of
the movement, who ceases dancing for that purpose. In the meantime
all those who have relieved themselves step down and join in the
dance, which is furious and violent, inducing great perspiration and an
intolerable stench. No additional information was given further than
that the structure may have been used in this instance as a sudatory,
the urine and violent movements being deemed sufficient to supply the
necessary amount of moisture and heat to supply the participants with
a sweat-bath.—(Personal letter from Dr. W. J. Hoffman, Bureau of
Ethnology, Washington, D. C., June 16, 1890.)</p>

<p>Elliott describes the “Orgies” in the “Kashgas” as he styles them.
“The fire is usually drawn from the hot stones on the hearth.... A
kantog of chamber-lye poured over them, which, rising in dense clouds
of vapor, gives notice by its presence and its horrible ammoniacal odor
to the delighted inmates that the bath is on. The kashga is heated to
suffocation; it is full of smoke; and the outside men run in from their
huts with wisps of dry grass for towels and bunches of alder twigs to
flog their naked bodies.</p>

<p>“They throw off their garments; they shout and dance and whip
themselves into profuse perspiration as they caper in the hot vapor.
More of their disgusting substitute for soap is rubbed on, and produces
a lather, which they rub off with cold water.... This is the most enjoyable
occasion of an Indian’s existence, as he solemnly affirms.
Nothing else affords a tithe of the infinite pleasure which this orgy
gives him. To us, however, there is nothing about him so offensive as
that stench which such a performance arouses.”—(Henry W. Elliott,
“Our Arctic Province,” New York, 1887, p. 387.)</p>

<p>“Quoique généralement malpropres, ces gens ont, comme les autres
Inoits et la plupart des Indiens, la passion des bains de vapeur, pour
lesquels le kachim a son installation toujours prête.</p>

<p>“Avec l’urine qu’ils recueillent précieusement pour leurs opérations
de tannage, ils se frottent le corps; l’alcali, se mélangeant avec les
transpirations et les huiles dont le corps est imprégné, nettoie la peau
comme le ferait du savon; l’odeur âcre de cette liqueur putréfiée paraît
leur être agréable, mais elle saisit à la gorge les étrangers qui reculent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
suffoqués, et ont grand’peine à s’y faire. Horreur! horreur! oui, pour
ceux qui ont un pain de savon sur leur table à toilette; mais pour
ceux qui ne possèdent pas ce détersif?”—(“Les Primitifs,” Réclus,
p. 71, “Les Inoits Occidentaux.”)</p>

<p>“Nul s’étonnera que les Ouhabites et les Ougagos de l’Afrique orientale
en fassent toujours autant. Mais on a ses préférences. Ainsi
Arabes et Bedouines recherchent l’urine des chamelles. Les Banianes
de Momba se lavent la figure avec de l’Urine de vache, parceque,
disent-ils, la vache est leur mère. Cette dernière substance est aussi
employée par les Silésiennes contre les taches de rousseur. Les Chowseures
du Caucase la trouvent excellente pour entretenir la santé et
développer la luxuriance de la chevelure. A cette fin, ils recueillent
soigneusement le purin des étables, mais le liquide encore imprégné de
chaleur vitale passe pour le plus énergique. Les trayeuses flattent la
bête, lui sifflent un air, chatouillent certain organe et au moment
précis, avancent le crâne pour recevoir le flot qui s’épanche; la mère
industrieuse fait inonder la tête de son nourrisson en même temps que
la sienne.”—(Idem, p. 73.)</p>

<p>The “Estufa” of the Pueblos was no doubt, in the earlier ages of the
tribal life, a communal dwelling similar to the “yourts” of the Siberians,
like which it had but one large opening in the roof, for the entrance
of members of the family, or clan, and the egress of smoke. An
examination of the myths and folk-lore of Siberia might reveal to us
the birth and the meaning of the visits of our good old Christmas
friend, Santa Claus, who certainly never sprang from European soil. A
god, loaded with gifts for good little children, could descend the ladders
placed in the chimneys of “yourts” and “estufas,” but such a feat
would be an impossibility in the widest chimneys ever constructed in
Germany or England for private houses.</p>

<p>The habitations of the natives of Ounalashka, according to Langsdorff,
are made with the entrances through the roofs, precisely like
those of the people of Kamtchatka.—(“Voyages,” vol. ii. p. 32.)</p>

<p>The “Estufa” model was perpetuated in the Temples of India,
exactly as the Imperial market-places of Rome supplied the type of
the “Basilica” of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>An article in “Frazer’s Magazine,” signed F. P. C., gives the dimensions
of the great Snake Temple of Nakhon-Vat in Cambodia: “Six
hundred feet square at the base, ... rises in the centre to the height
of one hundred and eighty feet, ... probably the grandest temple in
the world.... In the inner court of this temple are ‘tanks’ in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
the living serpents dwelt and were adored.... The difference between
these ‘tanks’ and the ‘Public Estufas’ is simply this: the latter are
partially or almost completely roofed.”</p>

<p>Some time after reaching the conclusion just expressed and much
loss of study in a fruitless examination of Encyclopædias, which did
not contain so much as the name of the patron of childhood, the work
of Mr. George Kennan was perused in which the same views are anticipated
by a number of years; it is by no means the least important
fact in an extremely interesting volume.</p>

<p>“The houses, if houses they could be called, were about twenty feet
in height, rudely constructed of drift-wood which had been thrown up
by the sea, and could be compared in shape to nothing but hour-glasses.
They had no doors or windows of any kind, and could only
be entered by climbing up a pole on the outside, and slipping down
another pole through the chimney,—a mode of entrance whose practicability
depended entirely upon the activity and intensity of the fire
which burned underneath.</p>

<p>“The smoke and sparks, although sufficiently disagreeable, were
trifles of comparative insignificance. I remember being told, in early
infancy, that Santa Claus always came into a house through the chimney;
and, although I accepted the statement with the unreasoning
faith of childhood, I could never understand how that singular
feat of climbing down a chimney could be safely accomplished.... My
first entrance into a Korak ‘yourt,’ however, at Kamenoi, solved all
my childish difficulties, and proved the possibility of entering a house
in the eccentric way which Santa Claus is supposed to adopt.”—(George
Kennan, “Tent Life in Siberia,” 12th edition, New York,
1887, p. 222.)</p>

<p>Steller describes a Festival of the Kamtchatkans occurring at the
end of November, after the winter provisions are in; in this, one party,
on the outside of the house, attempts to lower a birch branch down
through the chimney; the party on the inside attempts to capture it.—(Steller,
“Kamtchatka,” translated by Mr. Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>“Every time they make water, or other unclean exercise of nature,
they wash those parts, little regarding who stands by. Before prayer,
they wash both face and hands, sometimes the head and privities.”—(Blount,
“Voy. into the Levant,” in Pinkerton, vol. x. p. 261.)</p>

<p>“Among the Negroes of Guinea, when a wife is pregnant for the first
time, she must perform certain ‘ceremonies,’ among which is ‘going

boys and girls, who fling all manner of dung and filth at her in her way
to the sea, where she is ducked and made clean.”—(Bosman, “Guinea,”
in Pinkerton, vol. xvi. p. 423.)</p>

<p>“In 1847, I was then twenty-six years old, once an old woman (in
Cherbourg) came to me with a washing-pan, and asked me to piss into
it, as the urine of a stout, healthy young man was required to wash
the bosoms of a young woman who was just delivered of a child.”—(Personal
letter from Captain Henri Jouan, French Navy, to Captain
Bourke, dated Cherbourg, France, July 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>In Scotland, the breasts of a young mother were washed with salt
and water to ensure a good flow of milk. The practice is alluded to in
the following couplet from “The Fortunate Shepherdess,” by Alexander
Ross, 1778.</p>

<p class="noindent">(Quoted in Brand, “Pop. Ant.” vol. ii. p. 80, art. “Christening Customs.”)</p>

<p>This practice seems closely allied to the one immediately preceding.
We shall have occasion to show that salt and water, holy water, and
other liquids superseded human urine in several localities, Scotland
among others.</p>

<p>“Being to wean one of their children, the father and mother lay him
on the ground, and whilst they do that which modesty will not permit
me to name, the father lifts him by the arm, and so holds him for
some time, hanging in the air, falsely believing that by these means he
will become more strong and robust.”—(Father Merolla, “Voyage to
the Congo,” in Pinkerton, vol. xvi. p. 237, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1682.)</p>

<p>In the Bareshnun ceremony, the Parsee priest “has to undergo
certain ablutions wherein he has to apply to his body cow’s urine, and
sand and clay, which seem to have been the common and cheapest disinfectant
known to the ancient Iranians.”—(Dr. J. W. Kingsley, Personal
letter to Captain Bourke, apparently citing “The History of the
Parsees,” by Dosabhai Framje Karaka.)</p>

<p>“A few days after birth, or according to the fancy of the parents, an
‘angekok,’ who by relationship or long acquaintance with the family,
has attained terms of great friendship, makes use of some vessel and
with the urine of the mother washes the infant, while all the gossips
around pour forth their good wishes for the little one to prove an active
man, if a boy, or, if a girl, the mother of plenty of children. The
ceremony, I believe, is never omitted, and is called Gogsinariva.”—(“The
Central Eskimo,” Boas, p. 610, quoting G. F. Lyon, “Private
Journal of H. M. S. Hecla, during the recent Voyage of Discovery

<p>“Buffalo dung I have seen carefully arranged in (Crow) Indian
dance tepees, having apparently some connection with the ceremonies.”—(Personal
letter from Dr. A. B. Holder, Memphis, Tenn., to Captain
Bourke, Feb. 6, 1890.)</p>

<p>“In one of the sacred dances of the Cheyennes, there is to be seen an
altar surrounded by a semi-circle of buffalo chips. This dance or ceremony
is celebrated for the purpose of getting an abundance of ponies.”—(See
the description in Dodge’s “Wild Indians,” pp. 127, 128.)</p>

<p>The sacred pipes used in the Sun Dance of the Sioux are so placed
that the bowl rests upon a “buffalo chip.”—(“The Sun Dance of
the Ogallalla Sioux,” Alice Fletcher, in “Proceed. American Association
for the Advancement of Science,” 1882.)</p>

<p>The drinking of the water in which a new-born babe had been bathed
is intimated in the myths of the Samoans. When the first baby was
born “Salevao provided water for washing the child, and made it Saor,
sacred to Moa. The rocks and the earth said they wished to get some
of that water to drink. Salevao replied that if they got a bamboo he
would send them a streamlet through it, and hence the origin of
springs.”—(“Samoa,” Turner, London, 1884, p. 10.)</p>

<p>Although it is not so stated in the text, yet from analogy with other
cosmogonies we may entertain a suspicion as to how the god provided
the water,—no doubt from his own person.</p>

<h3>STERCORACEOUS CHAIR OF THE POPES.</h3>

<p>“Stercoraire, Chaire (Hist. des Papes); c’est ainsi qu’on nommoit à
Rome, au rapport de M. L’Enfant, une chaire qui étoit autrefois devant
le portique de la basilique, sur laquelle on faisait asseoir le Pape le
jour de sa consécration. Le chœur de musique lui chantoit alors ces
paroles du Psaume 113, selon l’Hébreu, et le 112, selon la Vulgate, v. 6,
et suiv. ‘Il tire de la poussière celui qui est dans l’indigence et il
élève le pauvre de son avilissement pour le placer avec les princes de
son peuple;’ c’étoit pour insinuer au Pape, dit cardinal Raspon, la
vertu de l’humilité, qui doit être la compagne de sa grandeur. Cet usage
fut aboli par Léon X, qui n’étoit pas né pour ces sortes de minuties.”—(“Encyc.
ou Dict. Raison. des Sciences,” etc., Neufchatel, 1765, tome
quinzième, article as above.)</p>

<p>Consult Ducange also, “Stercoraria Sedes,” wherein it is stated that
the use of this chair could be traced back to the tenth century.</p>

<p>“Stercoraria sedes, in qua creati pontifices ad frangendos elatos
spiritus considerent, unde dicta.”—(Baronius, “Annales,” Lucca,
1758.)</p>

<p>Read also the remarks upon the subject of Ducking Stools, from
which this seems to have been derived, under “Ordeals and Punishments.”</p>

<p>Father Le Jeune relates, among the ceremonies observed by the
Indians of Canada upon capturing a bear, that no women were allowed
to remain in the lodge with the carcass, and that special care was taken
to prevent dogs from licking the blood, gnawing the bones, or <i>eating
the excrement</i>.—(See “Relations,” 1634, vol. i., Quebec, 1858.)</p>

<span class="smaller">ORDURE IN SMOKING.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Among all the observances of the every-day life of the American
aborigines, none is so distinctly complicated with the religious
idea as smoking; therefore, should the use of excrement, human or
animal, be detected in this connection, full play should be given to the
suspicion that a hidden meaning attaches to the ceremony. This
would appear to be the view entertained by the indefatigable missionary,
De Smet, who records such a custom among the Flatheads and
Crows in 1846: “To render the odor of the pacific incense agreeable to
their gods it is necessary that the tobacco and the herb (skwiltz), the
usual ingredients, should be mixed with a small quantity of buffalo
dung.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and others of the plains tribes, to
whom the buffalo is a god, have the same or an almost similar custom.</p>

<p>The Hottentots, when in want of tobacco, “smoke the dung of the
two-horned rhinoceros or of elephants.”—(Thurnberg’s Account of
the Cape of Good Hope, quoted in Pinkerton, vol. xvi. p. 141.)</p>

<p>The followers of the Grand Lama, as already noted, make use of his
dried excrements as snuff, and an analogous employment of the dried
dung of swine retained a place in the medical practice of Europe until
the beginning of the present century, and may, perhaps, still survive
in the Folk-medicine of isolated villages.</p>

<p>The people of Achaia say “that the smoke of dried cow dung, that
of the animal when grazing I mean, is remarkably good for phthisis,
inhaled through a reed.”—(Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. xxviii. cap. 67.)</p>

<p>Dung is also used in Central Africa. “A huge bowl is filled with
tobacco and clay and sometimes with a questionable mixture, the
fumes are inhaled until the smoker falls stupefied or deadly sick—this
effect alone being sought for.”—(“Central Africa,” Chaillé Long,
p. 266.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“In Algeria, gazelle droppings are put in snuff and smoking tobacco;
the Mongol Tartars mix the ashes of yak manure with their snuff.”—(Personal
letter from W. W. Rockhill.)</p>

<p>Mr. Rudyard Kipling shows in his “Plain Tales from the Hills”
(“Miss Youghal’s Sais”) that the native population of India is accustomed
to use a mixture of one part of tobacco to three of cow-dung.</p>

</div>

<p>“To multiply and replenish the earth,” was the first command
given to man; to love, and to desire to be loved in return, is
the strongest impulse of our nature, and therefore it need surprise no
student who sets about investigating the occult properties attributed
to the human and animal egestæ to find them in very general use in
the composition of love-philters, as antidotes to such philters, as
aphrodisiacs, as antiphrodisiacs, and as aids to delivery.</p>

<h3>ORDURE IN LOVE-PHILTERS.</h3>

<p>Love-sick maidens in France stand accused of making as a philter a
cake into whose composition entered “nameless ingredients,” which
confection, being eaten by the refractory lover, soon caused a revival
of his waning affections.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This was considered to savor so strongly of
witchcraft that it was interdicted by councils.</p>

<p>The witches and wizards of the Apache tribe make a confection or
philter, one of the ingredients of which is generally human ordure, as
the author learned from some of them a few years since. The Navajoes,
of same blood and language as the Apaches, employ the dung of
cows (as related in the “Snake Dance of the Moquis,” p. 27.)</p>

<p>Frommann gives an instance of a woman who made love-philters
out of her own excrement. As late as Frommann’s day, the use of
such philters was punishable with death. The remedies for love-philters
were composed of human skull, coral, verbena flowers,
secundines, or after-birth, and a copious flow of urine. He says that
Paracelsus taught that when one person ate or drank anything given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
off by the skin of another, he would fall desperately in love with that
other. “Quod illi, qui ederunt aut biberunt aliquid a scorte datum,
in amorem alicujus conjiciantur et rapiantur.” (Frommann, “Tractatus
de Fascinatione,” pp. 820, 826, 970, quoting Paracelsus, Tract. 1,
de Morbis Amantium, cap. v.) He also cites Beckherius to the effect
that some philters were made of perspiration, menses, or semen.—(Idem,
quoting Beckherius, “Sapgyr. Microc.,” p. 89.)</p>

<p>John Leo, in Purchas (vol. ii. p. 850), speaks of “the roote Surnay
growing also upon the Western part of Mount Atlas.... The inhabitants
of Mount Atlas doe commonly report that many of those damosels
which keepe Cattell upon the said Mountaines, lose their Virginitie
by no other occasion than by making water upon said Roote....
This roote is said to be comfortable and preseruatiue unto the
priuie partes of man, and being drunk in an Electuary to stirre up
Venereal lust.”</p>

<p>Reginald Scot mentions a “Wolves yard” among the ingredients in
a love-philter.—(“Discoverie of Witchecraft,” London, 1651, p. 62.)</p>

<p>Human ordure was in constant use in the manufacture of these
philters, being administered both internally and externally. On this
point it may be proper to give the exact words of Schurig, who explains
that it was sometimes put in porridge, and in other cases in the
shoes. In the last example, the man who made such use of the
excrement of his lady love was completely cured of his infatuation,
after wearing the defiled shoes one hour. “Contra Philtræ tam interne
quam externe adhiberi solet amatæ puellæ stercus, ab exsiccato
enim atque in pulmento personæ philtratæ exhibito amorem in maximam
antipathiam mutatam annotavit Eberhardus Gockelius ...
etiam Capitanei cujusdam meminit qui, postquam amasiæ stercus
novis calceis imposuerat, posteaque iisdem per integram horam spatiatus
fuerat ab illius amore liberabatur.”—(“Chylologia,” p. 774.)</p>

<p>Leopard-dung was in repute as an aphrodisiac.—(Idem, p. 820.)</p>

<p>“The urine that has been voided by a bull immediately after covering ...
taken in drink,” as an aphrodisiac; and “the groin well
rubbed with earth moistened with this urine.”—(Pliny, Bohn, lib.
xxviii. cap. 80.)</p>

<p>“The wizard, witch, sorcerer, druggist, doctor, or medicine man
... played the part of an ochreous Cupid. Instead of smiles and
bright eyes, his dealings were with some nasty stuff put into beer, or
spread slyly upon bread.... In the Shroft book of Egbert, Archbishop
of York, one of their methods is censured; and it is so filthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
that I must leave it in the obscurity of the original old English.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 45.)</p>

<p>An ointment of the gall of goats, incense, goat-dung, and nettle-seeds
was applied to the privy parts previous to copulation to increase
the amorousness of women.—(See “Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 351,
quoting Sextus Placitus.)</p>

<p>“Love-charms are made of ingredients too disgusting to mention,
and are given by the Mussulmans to women to persuade them to love
them.”—(“Indo-Mahomedan Folk-Lore,” No. 3, H. C., p. 180, in
“Notes and Queries,” 3d series, vol. xi., London, 1867.)</p>

<p>Vambéry has this obscure passage: “The good woman had the
happy idea to prescribe to the sick Khan five hundred doses of that
medicine said to have worked such beneficial effects upon the renowned
poet-monarch of ancient history.... The Khan of Khiva took from
fifty to sixty of these pills ‘for impuissance.’”—(“Travels in Central
Asia,” New York, 1865, p. 166.)</p>

<p>Besides these elements there were employed others equally disgusting;
for example, the catamenial fluid, which seems to have
been in high repute for such purposes: “Quædam auditæ sunt jactantes
se sua excrementa propinasse, præcipue menstrua, quibus cogant
se amari.”—(“Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 45, quoting Cæsalpinus,
“Dæmonum Investigatio,” fol. 154 b. Cæsalpinus died in 1603.)</p>

<p>“He has taken the enchanted philter, and soiled my garment with
it.”—(“Chaldean Magic,” Lenormant, London, 1877, p. 61, quoting
an Incantation of the Chaldean sorcerers. It is, of course, a matter of
impossibility to tell of what this philter was composed.)</p>

<p>“They say that if a man takes a frog, and transfixes it with a reed
entering its body at the sexual parts, and coming out at the mouth,
and then dips the reed in the menstrual discharge of his wife, she will
be sure to conceive an aversion for all paramours.”—(Pliny, lib. xxxii.
cap. 13.)</p>

<p>“Sanguis menstruus, qui, a Paracelso vocatur Zenith Juvencularum;
hic primus virginis impollutæ multa in se habet arcana non semper
revelanda. Ut autem pauca adducam, extreme linteum a primo sanguine
menstruo madidum et exsiccatum, hanc denuo humectatum et
applicatum pedi podagraci, mirum quantum lenit dolores podagræ.
Idem linteum, si applicetur parti Erysipelate affectæ, incontinenti erysipelas
curat. In affectibus ab incantationibus et veneficiis oriundis
multa præstat sanguis menstruus; nam et ipse sanguis menstruus ad
veneficia adhibetur, et sunt mulieres, quæ pro philtris utuntur sanguine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
suo menstruo.” He instances such a philter, made with menstrual
and a hare’s blood, which drove the recipient to mania and
suicide. It was further used to make people “impenetrable” to an
enemy’s weapon, and to cure burning sores. (See Michael Etmuller,
“Opera Omnia,” vol. ii. p. 270, art. “Schrod. Dilucid. Zoölogia.”)</p>

<p>A medical student was frequently courted by his neighbor’s daughter,
but he disregarded her advances. At one time, however, he slept
with the brother of the girl in her father’s house, and after that was
so infatuated that he would rise at midnight to kiss the jambs of the
door of her house. Some time afterwards, he sent his clothes to a
tailor to be mended, and, sewed up in his trousers, was found a little
bundle of hair from an unmentionable part of the girl’s body, containing
the initials S. T. I. A. M., which were by some interpreted
to mean “Sathanas te trahat in amorem mei.” As soon as this little
bunch of hair was burned, the poor fellow had rest.—(Paullini, pp.
258, 259.)</p>

<p>Human semen was equally used for the very same purpose. There
is nothing to show whether male lovers used this ingredient, and
maidens the menstrual liquid, or both indiscriminately; but it seems
plausible to believe that each sex adhered to its own excretion.</p>

<p>“Semen, f. Sperma, non modo comperimus per se a nonnullis ad
veneris scilicet ligaturam maleficam dissolvendam, sed et Momiam
magneticam inde fieri quæ amoris concilietur fervor. Quin et homunculum
suum inde meditatur Paracelsus.”—(Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,”
vol. ii. p. 266.)</p>

<p>Semen, Beckherius informs us, was used in breaking down “Ligatures”
placed by witches or the devil, and in restoring impaired
virility. But it was sometimes employed in a manner savoring so
strongly of impiety that Beckherius preferred not to speak further.—(“Medicus
Microcosmus,” p. 122.)</p>

<p>Flemming tells us that we should not pass over in silence the fact
that human seed has been employed by some persons as medicine.
They believed that its magnetic power could be used in philters, and
that by it a lover could feed the flame of his mistress’s affections;
hence from it was prepared what was known as “magnetic mummy,”
which, being given to a woman, threw her into an inextinguishable
frensy of love for the man or animal yielding it,—a suggestion of
animal worship. Others credited it with a wonderful efficacy in relieving
inveterate epilepsy, or restoring virility impaired by incantation
or witchcraft; for which purpose it was used while still fresh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
before exposure to the air, in pottage, mixed with the powder of mace.
Flemming alludes to a horrible use of relics, good and bad, upon which
human semen had been ejaculated; but this involved so much of the
grossest impiety that he declined to enter into full details.—(“De
Remediis ex Corpore Humano desumtis,” Samuel Augustus Flemming,
Erfurt, 1738, p. 22.)</p>

<p>The love-philter described in the preceding paragraph recalls a somewhat
analogous practice among the Manicheans, whose eucharistic
bread was incorporated or sprinkled with human semen, possibly with
the idea that the bread of life should be sprinkled with the life-giving
excretion.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Albigenses, or Catharistes, their descendants, are alleged to
have degenerated into or to have preserved the same vile superstition.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Understanding that these allegations proceed from hostile sources,
their insertion in this category has been permitted only upon the theory
that as the Manichean ethics and ritual present resemblances to both
the Parsee and Buddhist religions (from which they may to some extent
have originated), there is reason for supposing that ritualistic
ablutions, aspersions, and other practices analogous to those of the
great sect farther to the east, may have been transmitted to the younger
religion in Europe.</p>

<p>The following is taken from an episcopal letter of Burchard, Bishop
of Worms:—</p>

<p>“N’avez vous pas fait ce que certaines femmes ont coutume de faire?
Elles se dépouillent de leurs habits, oignent leur corps nu avec du
miel, étendent à terre un drap, sur lequel elles répandent du bléd, se
roulent dessus à plusieurs reprises; puis elles recueillent avec soin tous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
les grains qui se sont attachés à leur corps, les mettent sur la meule
qu’elles font tourner à rebours. Quand ils sont réduits en farine, elles
en font un pain qu’elles donnent à manger à leurs maris afin qu’ils
s’affaiblissent et qu’ils meurent. Si vous l’avez fait, vous ferez pénitence
pendant quarante jours au pain et à l’eau.... Fecisti quod
quædam mulieres facere solent? Tollunt menstruum suum sanguinem
et immiscent cibo vel potui, et dant viris suis ad manducandum vel
ad bibendum, ut plus diligantur ab eis.... Fecisti quod quædam
mulieres facere solent? Prosternunt se in faciem, et discoopertis natibus,
jubent ut supra nudas nates, conficiatur panis, et eo decocto tradunt
maritis suis ad comedendum. Hoc ideo faciunt ut plus exardescant in
amorem illarum. Si fecisti duos annos per legitimas ferias pœnitias.”—(Dulaure,
“Traité des Différens Cultes,” vol. ii. p. 262 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The method of divination by which maidens strove to rekindle the
expiring flames of affection in the hearts of husbands and lovers by
making cake from dough kneaded on the woman’s posterior, as given
in preceding paragraph, seems to have held on in England as a game
among little girls, in which one lies down on the floor, on her back,
rolling backwards and forwards, and repeating the following lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cockledy bread, mistley cake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you do that for our sake.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While one of the party so lay down the rest of the party sat round;
they lay down and rolled in this manner by turns.</p>

<p>Cockle Bread. This singular game is thus described by Aubray and
Kennett: “Young wenches have a wanton sport which they call
‘moulding of cockle bread,’ viz.: they get upon a table-board, and
then gather up their knees as high as they can, and then they wobble
to and fro, as if they were kneading of dough, and say these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘My dame is sick, and gone to bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll go mould my cockle bread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up with my heels, and down with my head!—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this is the way to mould cockle bread.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—(Quoted in Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. ii. p. 414, article
“Cockle Bread.”)</p>

<p>These words “mistley” and “cockledy” were not to be found in
any of the lexicons examined, or in the “Dictionary of Obsolete and
Provincial English” of Thomas Wright, M. A., London, 1869, although
in the last was the word “mizzly” meaning “mouldy.” It may possibly
mean mistletoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Cockle is the unhappy ‘lolium’ of Virgil, thought, if mixed with
bread, to produce vertigo and headache; therefore, at Easter, parties
are made to pick it out from the wheat. They take with them cake,
cider, and toasted cheese. The first person who picks the cockle
from the wheat has the first kiss of the maid and the first slice
of the cake.”—(Fosbroke, “Encyclopædia of Antiquities,” vol. ii.
p. 1040.)</p>

<p>Vallencey describes a very curious ceremony among the Irish in the
month of September. “On the eve of the full moon of September
... straw is burnt to embers, and in the embers each swain in turn
hides a grain, crying out, ‘I’ll tear you to pieces if you find my grain.’
His maiden lover seeks, and great is her chagrin if she does not find it.
On producing it, she is saluted by the company with shouts; her lover
lays her first on her back, and draws her by the heels through the
embers, then turning her on her face repeats the ceremony until her
nudities are much scorched. This is called <i>posadamin</i>, or the meal-wedding....
When all the maidens have gone through this ceremony,
they sit down and devour the roasted wheat, with which they
are sometimes inebriated.”—(“De Rebus Hibernicis,” vol. ii. p. 559.)</p>

<p>He undoubtedly means ergot; he himself says that it is “a grain
that is sometimes found growing amongst the wheat in Ireland.” He
also calls these “weddings” a “Druidical custom.”—(Idem, p. 598.)</p>

<p>A similar phallic dance is alluded to in John Graham Dalyell’s
“Superstitions of Scotland,” Edinburgh, 1834, p. 219.</p>

<p>In Sardinia “the village swains go about in a group ... to wait for
the girls who assemble on the public square to celebrate the festival.
Here a great bonfire is kindled, round which they dance and make
merry. Those who wish to be ‘sweethearts of Saint John’ act as follows:
The young man stands on one side of the bonfire, and the girl
on the other; and they, in a manner, join hands by each grasping a
long stick, which they pass three times backwards and forwards across
the fire, thus thrusting their hands thrice rapidly into the flames.”
At this dance, we read of “a Priapus-like figure, made of paste; but
this custom, rigorously forbidden by the Church, has fallen into disuse.”
(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 291.) “In some parts
of Germany young men and girls leap over midsummer bonfires for
the express purpose of making the hemp or flax grow tall.”—(Idem,
p. 293.)</p>

<p>“Amongst the Kara-Kirghis barren women roll themselves on the
ground under a solitary apple-tree in order to obtain offspring.” (Idem,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
vol. i. p. 73.) That this is a manifestation of tree worship, the author
leaves us no room to doubt; and a consultation of his text will be rewarded
by several examples of a still more definite character,—such
as marriage with trees, wearing the bark as a garment in the hope of
progeny, etc.</p>

<p>Hoffman mentions a widow among the Pennsylvania Germans who
“became impressed with a boatman with whom she casually became
acquainted, and as he evinced no response to her numerous manifestations
of regard, she adopted the following method to compel him to
love her, even against his will. With the blade of a penknife she scraped
her knee until she had secured a small quantity of the cuticle, baked it
in a specially prepared cake, and sent it to him, though with what result
is not known. The woman was known to have the utmost faith
in the charm.”—(“Folk-Medicine of Pennsylvania Germans,” American
Philosophical Society, 1889.)</p>

<p>“I was at Madrid in 1784.... A beggar, who generally took his
stand at the door of a church, had employed his leisure in inventing
and selling a species of powder to which he attributed miraculous
effects. It was composed of ingredients the mention of which would
make the reader blush. The beggar had drawn up some singular formularies
to be repeated at the time of taking the powder, and required,
to give it its effect, that those who took it should put themselves into
certain postures more readily imagined than described. His composition
was one of those amorous philtres in which our ignorant ancestors
had so much faith; his, he pretended, had the power of restoring
a disgusted lover and of softening the heart of a cruel fair one.”—(Bourgoanne’s
“Travels in Spain,” in Pinkerton, vol. v. p. 413.)</p>

<p>“When a young man is trying to win the love of a reluctant girl he
consults the medicine-man, who then tries to find some of the urine
and saliva which the girl has voided, as well as the sand upon
which it has fallen. He mixes these with a few twigs of certain woods,
and places them in a gourd, and gives them to the young man, who
takes them home, and adds a portion of tobacco. In about an hour
he takes out the tobacco and gives it to the girl to smoke; this effects
a complete transformation in her feelings.”—(“Conversation with
Muhongo,” an African boy from Angola, translated by Rev. Mr.
Chatelain.)</p>

<p>Lovers who wished to increase the affections of their mistresses were
recommended to try a transfusion of their own blood into the loved
one’s veins.—(Flemming, “De Remediis,” etc., p. 15.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>See notes taken from Flemming, under “Perspiration;” also under
“After-Birth and Woman’s Milk,” and under “Catamenial Fluid.”</p>

<p>Beaumont and Fletcher may have had such customs in mind when
writing “Wit without Money.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ralph.</i> Pray, empty my right shoe, that you made your chamber-pot,
and burn some rosemary in it.”—(v. i.)</p>

<p>Rosemary, like juniper (q. v.), was extensively used for disinfecting
sleeping apartments.</p>

<h3>ANTI-PHILTERS.</h3>

<p>To protect the population from the baleful effects of the love-philter,
there was, fortunately, the anti-philter, in which, strangely enough, we
come upon the same ingredients. Thus mouse-dung, applied in “the
form of a liniment, acts as an antiphrodisiac,” according to Pliny
(lib. xxviii. cap. 80). “A lizard drowned in urine has the effect of an
antiphrodisiac upon the man whose urine it is.” (Idem, lib. xxx. cap.
49.) “The same property is to be attributed to the excrement of snails
and pigeon’s dung, taken with oil and wine.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>A powerful antiphrodisiac was made of the urine of a bull and the
ashes of a plant called “brya.” “The charcoal too of this wood is
quenched in urine of a similar nature, and kept in a shady spot. When
it is the intention of the party to rekindle the flames of desire, it is
set on fire again. The magicians say that the urine of a eunuch will
have a similar effect.”—(Idem, lib. xxiv. cap. 42.)</p>

<p>“According to Osthanes ... a woman will forget her former love
by taking a he-goat’s urine in drink.”—(Idem, lib. xxviii. cap. 77.)</p>

<p>Hen-dung was an antidote against philters, especially those made
of menstrual blood. “Contra Philtra magica, in specie ex sanguine
menstruo femineo.” (“Chylologia,” p. 816, 817.) Dove-dung was also
administered for the same purpose, but was not quite so efficacious.</p>

<p>A journeyman cabinet-maker had been given a love-potion by a
young woman, so that he couldn’t keep away from her. His mother
then bought a pair of new shoes for him, put into them certain herbs,
and in them he had to run to a certain town. A can of urine was
then put into his right shoe, out of which he drank, whereupon he perfectly
despised the object of his former affection.</p>

<p>A prostitute gave a love-potion to a captain in the army. Some of
her ordure was placed in a new shoe, and after he had walked therein
an hour, and had his fill of the smell, the spell was broken. Paullini
here quotes Ovid,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ille tuas redolens Phineu medicamina mensas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Non semel est stomacho nausea facta meo.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A man was given in his food some of the dried ordure of a woman
whom he formerly loved, and that created a terrible antipathy toward
her.—(Paullini, p. 258.)</p>

<p>“The seeds of the tamarisk mixed in a drink or meat with the urine
of a castrated ox will put an end to Venus.”—(“Saxon Leechdoms,”
vol. i. p. 43, quoting Pliny, lib. 21, c. 92.)</p>

<p>“Galenos says that the priests eat rue and agnus castus, it seems,
as a refrigerative.”—(Idem, p. 43.)</p>

<p>The herb rue was used by the Romans as an amulet against witchcraft,
and was also employed in the exorcisms of the Roman Catholic
Church.—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 315, article
“Rural Charms.”)</p>

<p>An examination of the best available authorities upon the properties
of this plant disclosed the following: “It was formerly called ‘herb of
grace’ (see Hamlet, act iv. scene 5), because it was used for sprinkling
the people with holy water. It was in great repute among the
ancients, having been hung about the neck as an amulet against witchcraft,
in the time of Aristotle.... It is a powerful stimulant.”
(Chambers’s Encyclopædia, article “Rue.”) “Rue is stimulant and
anti-spasmodic; ... occasionally increases the secretions.... It appears
to have a tendency to act upon the uterus; ... in moderate
doses proving emmenagogue, and in larger producing a degree of irritation
in the organ which sometimes determines abortion; ... taken
by pregnant women, ... miscarriage resulted; ... used in amenorrhœa
and in uterine hemorrhages.” (“United States Dispensatory,”
Philadelphia, 1886, article “Ruta.”) Here are presented almost the
same conditions as were found in the mistletoe,—the plant had a
direct, irritant action upon the genito-urinary organs, and in all probability
was employed to induce the sacred urination and to asperse
the congregation with the fluid for which holy water was afterwards
substituted.</p>

<p>Rue and agnus castus are mentioned by Avicenna as medicines
which “coitus desiderium sedant.” (Vol. i. pp. 266, b 45, 406, a 60.)
The same author (vol. i. p. 906, a 63) mentions rue with the testicles
of a fox as an Aphrodisiac, and the testicles of the goat are mentioned
in the same connection.—(Idem, p. 907, b 67.)</p>

<p>Dulaure (“Des Différens Cultes,” vol. ii. p. 288) speaks of certain
“fasciniers” or charlatans, who vended secretly love-philters to barren<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
women. “Ils prononçaient pour opérer leurs charmes des mots
latins et avaient l’intention de fixer dans les alimens des époux une
poudre provenant des parties sexuelles d’un loup.”</p>

<p>Beckherius repeats the antidote for a love-philter of placing some of
the woman’s ordure in the man’s shoe: “Si, in amantis calceum, stercus
amatæ ponatur;” and he also cites the couplet from Ovid already
quoted, p. 225.</p>

<p>“Secundines” were also employed to render abortive the effects of
philters. (See Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” Schroderi dilucidati Zoölogia,
vol. ii. p. 265.) “In philtris curandis spiritus secundinæ vel
pulvis secundinæ mirabilis facit.” This was of great use in epilepsy,
but should be, if possible, “secundinam mulieris sanæ, si potest esse
primiparæ et quæ filium enixa fuit.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 271.)</p>

<p>Against philters, as well as to counteract the efforts of witches attacking
people just entering the married state, by such maleficent
means as “ligatures,” and other obstacles, ordure was facile princeps
as a remedy. Likewise, to break up a love affair, nothing was superior
to the simple charm of placing some of the ordure of the person seeking
to break away from love’s thraldom in the shoe of the one still
faithful. It is within the bounds of possibility that this remedy would
be found potential even in our own times, if faithfully applied. “Contra
philtra, item pro ligatis et maleficiatis a mulieribus sequens Johannes
Jacobus Weckerus ... pone de egestione seu alvi excremento
ipsius mulieris mane in fotulari dextro maleficiati et statim cum ipse
sentiet fœtorum solvitur maleficium.... Quod si in amantis calceum
stercus amatæ posueris, ubi odorem senserit, solvitur amor,” etc. (several
examples are given).—(“Chylologia,” p. 791.)</p>

<p>Mr. Chrisfield, of the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., imparts
a fact which dovetails in with the foregoing item in a very interesting
manner. He says that, in his youth, which was passed on the
Eastern Shore of Maryland, he learned that, among the more ignorant
classes of that section it was a rule that when a father observed the
growing affection of his son for some young girl, he should endeavor
to obtain a little of her excrement, and make the youth wear it under
the left arm-pit; if he remained constant in his devotion after being
subjected to this test, the father felt that it would be useless to interpose
objection to the nuptials.</p>

<p>There is a case mentioned in Scotland in which “aversion was inspired
on the part of the female.” To remedy this “the man got a
cake” (ingredients not mentioned) “to be put under his left arm, betwixt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
his shirt and his skin, observing silence, until the nuptial couch
was sprinkled with water and the mystical cake withdrawn.”—(“Superstitions
of Scotland,” Dalyell, p. 305.)</p>

<p>One might safely wager guineas to shillings that, in the above example
the mystical cake was the legitimate descendant of one formerly
compounded of very unsavory ingredients, and that the water with
which the nuptial couch was to be sprinkled, had replaced a fluid
closely related to the liquid employed by the Hottentots on such
occasions.</p>

<p>“To procure the dissolving of bewitched and constrained love, the
party bewitched must make a jakes (i. e. privy) of the lover’s shoe.
And to enforce a man, how proper soever he be, to love an old hag, she
gives unto him to eate (among other meates) her own dung.”—(Scot’s
“Discoverie,” p. 62.)</p>

<p>This subject of “Nouer l’aiguillette” is referred to by Dulaure.—(“Traité
des Dif. Cultes,” vol. ii. p. 288.)</p>

<p>“If a man makes water upon a dog’s urine, he will become disinclined
to copulation, they say.”—(Pliny, lib. xxx. c. 49.)</p>

<p>“Beware thee that thou mie not where the hound mied; some men
say that there a man’s body changeth so that he may not, when he
cometh to bed with his wife, bed along with her.”—(De Med. de Quad.
of Sextus Placitus, from “Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 365.)</p>

<span class="smaller">SIBERIAN HOSPITALITY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>A curious manifestation of hospitality has been noticed among
the Tchuktchi of Siberia: “Les Tschuktschi offrent leurs femmes
aux voyageurs; mais ceux-ci, pour s’en rendre dignes, doivent se soumettre
à une épreuve dégoûtante. La fille ou la femme qui doit passer
la nuit avec son nouvel hôte lui présente une tasse pleine de son urine;
il faut qu’il s’en rince la bouche. S’il a ce courage, il est regardé
comme un ami sincère; sinon, il est traité comme un ennemi de la
famille.”—(Dulaure, “Des Divinités Génératrices,” Paris, 1825, p.
400.)</p>

<p>Among the Tchuktchees of Siberia, “it is a well known custom to
use the urine of both parties as a libation in the ceremony; and likewise
between confederates and allies, to pledge each other and swear
eternal friendship.”—(“In the Lena Delta,” Melville, p. 318.)</p>

<p>The presentation of women to distinguished strangers is a mark of
savage hospitality noted all over the world, but never in any other
place with the above peculiar accompaniment; yet Mungo Park assures
his readers that, during his travels in the interior of Africa, a
wedding occurred among the Moors while he was asleep. He was
awakened from his doze by an old woman bearing a wooden bowl,
whose contents she discharged full in his face, saying it was a present
from the bride.</p>

<p>Finding this to be the same sort of holy water with which a Hottentot
priest is said to sprinkle a newly married couple, he supposed it to
be a mischievous frolic, but was informed that it was a nuptial benediction
from the bride’s own person, and which, on such occasions, is
always received by the young unmarried Moors as a mark of distinguished
favor.—(Quoted in Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London,
1849, vol. ii. p. 152, article “Bride-Ales.” See also Mungo Park’s
“Travels in Africa,” New York, 1813, p. 109.)</p>

<p>In Hottentot marriages “the priest, who lives at the bride’s kraal,
enters the circle of the men, and coming up to the bridegroom, pisses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
a little upon him. The bridegroom receiving the stream with eagerness
rubs it all over his body, and makes furrows with his long nails
that the urine may penetrate the farther. The priest then goes to the
outer circle and evacuates a little upon the bride, who rubs it in with the
same eagerness as the bridegroom. To him the priest then returns, and
having streamed a little more, goes again to the bride and again scatters
his water upon her. Thus he proceeds from one to the other until he
has exhausted his whole stock, uttering from time to time to each of
them the following wishes, till he has pronounced the whole upon both:
‘May you live long and happily together. May you have a son before
the end of the year. May this son live to be a comfort to you in your
old age. May this son prove to be a man of courage and a good huntsman.’”—(Peter
Kolbein, Voy. to the Cape of Good Hope, in Knox,
“Voyages,” London, 1777, vol. ii. pp. 399, 400. This statement of
Kolbein is cited by Maltebrun, Univ. Geog. vol. ii. article “Cape of
Good Hope,” but he also mentions Thurnberg, Sparmann and Foster
as authorities. Pinkerton, vol. xvi. pp. 89 and 141, likewise quotes
from Thurnberg on this subject.)</p>

<p>“Have I not drunk to your health, swallowed flap-dragons, eat
glasses, drank wine, stabbed arms, and done all the offices of protested
gallantry for your sake?”—(Marston’s “Dutch Courtesan,”
London, 1605; see also footnote on the same point in the
“Honest Whore,” Thomas Dekkar, 1604, edition of London, 1825.
“Dutch flap-dragons,” “Healths in urine.” See also “A New Way
to Catch the Old One,” Thomas Middleton, 1608, ed. of Rev. Alex.
Dyce, London, 1840; footnote to above: “Drinking healths in urine
was another and more disgusting feat of gallantry.” Again, for flap-dragons,
see in “Ram Alley,” by Ludovick Barry, 1611, ed. of London,
1825.)</p>

<p>In the “Histoire Secrète du Prince Croq’ Étron,” M’lle Laubert,
Paris, 1790, Prince Constipati is entertained by the Princess Clysterine;
“elle lui donna de la limonade, de la façon d’Urinette” (p. 17).</p>

<p>Brand has a very interesting chapter, entitled “Drinking Wine in
the Church at Marriages,” in which it appears that the custom prevailed
very generally among nations of the highest civilization, of
having the bride, groom, and invited guests, share in a cup or chalice,
filled with some intoxicant; in England, a country which has never
raised the grape, this drink is wine; in Ireland, it was whiskey. Brand
traces it back to a Gothic origin, but he himself calls attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
breaking of wine-glasses at the marriage ceremony among Hebrews,
from which circumstance a still greater antiquity may be inferred.</p>

<p>“Cobbler’s punch,” urine with a cinder in it.—(Grose, “Dictionary
of Buckish Slang,” London, 1811.)</p>

<p>“A beautiful lady, bathing in a cold bath, one of her admirers, out
of gallantry, drank some of the water.”—(Idem, article “Toast.”)</p>

<p>“We were told that the priest (of the Hottentots) certainly gives
the nuptial benediction by sprinkling the bride and groom with his
urine.”—(Lieut. Cook, R. N., in “Hawkesworth’s Voyages,” London,
1773, vol. iii. p. 387.)</p>

<p>Similar statements are to be found in the writings of Hahn and
others of the Dutch missionaries to the natives of South Africa.</p>

<p>The malevolence of witchcraft seems to have taken the greatest
pleasure in subtle assaults upon those just entering the married state.
Fortunately, amulets, talismans, and counter-charms were within
reach of all who needed them. The best of all these was thought to
be urination through the wedding-ring.—(See Brand, “Pop. Ant.,”
vol. iii. p. 305.)</p>

<p>The variants of this practice are innumerable, and are referred to
by nearly all the old writers.</p>

<p>Beckherius tells his readers that to counteract the effects of witchcraft,
and especially of “Nouer l’Aiguillette” ... “Si per nuptialem
annulum sponsius mingat, fascina et Veneris impotentia solvetur, qua
a maleficiis ligatus fuit.”—(“Med. Microcos.” p. 66.)</p>

<p>“Pisse through a wedding-ring if you would know who is hurt in
his privities by witchcraft.”—(Reg. Scot, “Discoverie,” p. 64.)</p>

<p>“Si quis aliquo veneficio impotens ad usum veneris factus fuerit at
quam primum mingat per annulum conjugalem.”—(Frommann,
“Tract. de Fascinat.” p. 997.)</p>

<p>Etmuller did not believe that witches could “nouer l’aiguillette;”
he attributed that effect to excessive modesty; yet all the remedies
mentioned by him, by which the testes of the bridegroom were to be
anointed, contained “Zibethum” as an ingredient.—(See his “Opera
Omnia,” vol. i. p. 461 b, and 462 a.)</p>

<p>For loss of virility, Paullini recommends drinking the urine of a
bull, immediately after he has covered a cow, and smear the pubis
with the bull’s excrements; also piss through the engagement ring
(pp. 152, 153).</p>

<p>But when witches have been the occasion of such impotence, the
victim should urinate through the wedding ring immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
discovering his misfortune; he also advises urination upon a broom;
human ordure was also efficacious. Or, take castor-oil plant, put it
into a pot, add some of the patient’s urine, hermetically seal, boil
slowly, and then bury in an unfrequented spot. By this method, the
witches will either be made to piss blood, or have other tormenting
pains until they relieve the bewitched one.—(Idem, pp. 264, 265.)</p>

<p>Etmuller describes another “sympathetic” cure for this infirmity:
This prescribed that the bridegroom should catch a fish (the Latin
word is “lucium,” meaning probably our pike), forcibly open its
mouth, urinate therein, and throw the fish back in the water, upstream;
then try to copulate, taking care to urinate through the wedding-ring,
both before and after. “Si quis emat lucium piscem sexus
masculini, huic per vim aperiatur os, et in os ejus immittatur urinam,
maleficiati. Hic lucius ita vivus immittatur in fluvium, idque contra
ejusdem cursum ... subito namque tollitur maleficium si non sit
nimis inveteratum, etc.... probatum etiam fuit si sponsus ante copulationem
et etiam post eam mittat suam urinam per annulum sponsalitium
quem accepit a sponsa.” He gives another cure, of much the
same kind, which, however, required that the micturation through the
ring should be done in a cemetery while the patient was lying on his
back on a tombstone. “A vetula suppeditato dum scil. in cementerio
quodam missit urinam per annulum cujusdam lapidis sepulchro incumbentis.”—(Etmuller,
vol. i. p. 462 a, 462 b.)</p>

<p>This remedy is believed in and practised by the peasantry in some
parts of Germany to the present day. “A married man who has
become impotent through evil influences can obtain relief by forming
a ring with his thumb and forefinger, and urinating through it secretly.”—(“Sagen-märchen,
Volkaberglauben, aus Schwaben,” Drs.
Birlinger and Buck, Freiburg, 1861, p. 486.)</p>

<p>Grimm, in his “Teutonic Mythology” (vol. iii.) refers to “Nouer
l’aiguillette,” but adds nothing to what has been presented above.</p>

<p>There are certain quaint usages connected with weddings among the
peasantry of Russia, as well as among the rustic population of England,
which might excite the curiosity of antiquarians. In the first
case, there is a “sprinkling” with water once used by the bride for
the purpose of bathing her person; in the other, there is a “sale” of
a liquid by the bride, this liquid being an intoxicant.</p>

<p>Wedding ceremonies of the peasantry of Samogitia: “The bride
was led on the wedding-day three times round the fireplace of her
future husband; it was then customary to wash her feet, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
same water that had been used for that purpose the bridal bed, the
furniture, and all the guests were sprinkled.”—(Maltebrun, “Univ.
Geog.,” vol. ii. p. 548, art. “Russia.”)</p>

<p>By a reference back to page 60 of this volume, it will be seen that
the Queen of Madagascar favored her subjects in the same way. This
sprinkling with the water used as above may be a survival of a former
practice, in which the aspersion was with the urine of the bride.</p>

<p>“Bride-Ale, Bride-Bush, and Bride-Stake are nearly synonymous
terms, and are all derived from the circumstance of the bride’s selling
ale on the wedding-day, for which she received, by way of contribution,
whatever handsome price the friends assembled on the occasion
chose to pay her for it.” (Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” vol. ii. p. 143, art.
“Bride-Ales.”) In this article he introduces the story from Mungo
Park already given in these pages, and seems to have a suspicion that
the custom above described could be traced back to a rather unsavory
origin.</p>

<p>The derivation of the English word “bridal” is very obscure; Fosbroke
says that the word “bride-ale” comes from the bride’s selling
ale on her wedding-day, and the friends contributing what they liked
in payment of it.—(“Cyclop. of Antiq.,” vol. ii. p. 818, under
“Marriage” and “Bride-Ales.”)</p>

<p>The Latin name for beer or ale was “cerevisia,” which would seem
to be a derivative from the name of the goddess. It may, in earlier
ages, have been a beverage dedicated to that goddess, employed in her
libations, and held sacred as the means of producing the condition
of inebriation, which in all nations has been looked upon as sacred.
Réclus tells that there are still nations who regard their brewers as
priests, and there are others who exalt their milkmen to that office:
“Les Chewsoures du Caucase ont leurs prêtres brasseurs; les Todas
des Neilgherries leurs divins fromagiers.”—(“Les Primitifs,” p. 116,
article “Les Inoits Occidentaux.”)</p>

<p>Hazlitt mentions the case where the Fairies, having a mock baptism
and no water at hand, made use of strong beer.—(“Fairy
Tales,” London, 1875, p. 385.)</p>

<p>Beer would appear entitled to claim as old an origin as alcohol; it
is mentioned in the sacred books of the Buddhists of Tibet: “La
Bière d’hiver (dguntchang).”—(“Pratimoksha Sutra,” translated by
W. W. Rockhill, Paris, 1885, Société Asiatique.)</p>

<p>For the cure of sterility, Pliny says that “authors of the very
highest repute ... recommend the application of a pessary
made of the fresh excrement voided by an infant at the moment of its
birth.” The urine of eunuchs was considered to be “highly beneficial
as a promoter of fruitfulness in females.”—(Lib. xxviii. cap. 18.)</p>

<p>“A hawk’s dung, taken in honeyed wine, would appear to render
females fruitful.”—(Idem, lib. xxx. c. 44.)</p>

<p>“Ut mulier concipiat, infantis masculi stercus quod primum enatus
emittet, suppositum locis mulieris conceptionem facit et præstat.”—(Sextus
Placitus, “De Medicamentis ex Animalibus,” Lyons, 1537,
pages not numbered, article “De Puello et Puella Virgine.”)</p>

<p>Schurig recommends an application of bull-dung to the genitalia of
women to facilitate pregnancy. (“Chylologia,” vol. ii. p. 602.) The
woman drank her own urine to ease the pains of pregnancy. (Idem,
p. 535.) There is a method of inducing conception outlined in vol. ii.
p. 712, by the use of a bath of urine poured over rusty old iron.
Mouse-dung was applied as a pessary in pregnancy. (Idem, pp. 728,
729.) Hawk-dung drunk by a woman before coitus insured conception.
(Idem, p. 748.) Goose or fox dung rubbed upon the pudenda
of a woman aided in bringing about conception. (Idem, p. 748.)
Leopard-dung was also supposed to facilitate conception; pastilles were
made of it, and the sexual parts fumigated therewith; or a pessary
was inserted and kept in place for three days and three nights:
“Ea quamvis antea sterilis fuit, deinceps tamen concipiet.”—(Idem,
p. 820.)</p>

<p>But Schurig warns his readers that care must be exercised in the
use of such remedies. He gives an instance of a woman who applied
the dung of a wolf to her private parts, and soon after bearing a
child, found him possessed of a wolfish appetite.—(Idem, lib. i. cap. 1,
article “De Bulimo Brutorum,” p. 24.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“When ladies desire to know whether or not they are enceinte,
Paullini recommends that they urinate in an earthen vessel wherein a
needle has been thrown. Let it stand over night; should the needle
become covered with small red spots, the woman is enceinte; but
should it be black or rusty, she is not. To determine whether she is
to have a son or daughter, dig two small pits; put barley in one, and
wheat in the other; let the enceinte lady urinate into both; then
cover up the vessels with earth; if the wheat sprout first, it is to be a
son; if the barley sprout before the wheat, it is to be a daughter.”—(Paullini,
p. 163.)</p>

<p>Or, throw a pea into each parcel of urine; then the pea which germinates
first, etc., etc. “Aut injiciatur lens in unius cujusque urina
et cujus efflorescit, ille culpa caret,” is the method suggested by Danielus
Beckherius.—(“Med. Microcos. aut Spagyria Microcosmi,” pp.
60, 61, quoting from still older authorities.)</p>

<p>He gives still another plan: “If you wish to determine whether a
woman is to bear children, pour some of her urine upon marsh-mallows;
if they be found dry on the third day, she’ll not conceive.” “Si
explorare volueris, utrum mulier ad concipiendam sit idonea, tunc
super malvam sylvestram urinam ejus funde; si ille tertio die arida
fuerit, omnino minus idoneam illam habeto.”—(Idem, p. 61.)</p>

<p>Paullini urges that the excrements of goats, hawks, horses, geese,
and the urine of camels be taken to remedy sterility (p. 161).</p>

<p>And the very same remedies are given by Beckherius and still older
writers.</p>

<p>English women, in some localities, drank the urine of their husbands
to assist them in the hour of labor.</p>

<p>“In the collection entitled ‘Sylon, or the Wood’ (p. 130) we read
that ‘a few years ago, in this same village, the women in labor used to
drinke the urine of their husbands, who were all the while stationed,
as I have seen the cows in St. James’s Park, straining themselves to
give as much as they can.’”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” London,
1849, vol. iii. article, “Lady in the Straw.”)</p>

<p>“Mariti urina hausta partum difficilem facilitare dicitur.”—(Etmuller,
vol. ii. p. 265, Schroderi, “Dilucidati Zoölogia.”)</p>

<p>An instance of the drinking of her own urine by a pregnant woman
is to be read in Schurig (p. 45), art. “De Pica.”</p>

<p>The warm urine of the husband was drunk for the same purpose:
“Scil. Hartmannus commendat ut difficiliter pariens libat haustum
urinæ mariti sui et ita si hic fuerit genuinus fœtus parientam illam ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
parti solvi putat; ast si urinæ aliquid subest erit illud sali volatili
ad morem aliorum omnium volatilium, attribuendum.” (Etmuller,
vol. ii. pp. 171, 172.) Here we have the husband’s urine employed
not only as a medicine, but as a test of the wife’s fidelity.</p>

<p>John Moncrief directs that, to facilitate conception, a pessary should
be inserted in the vagina, of which hare’s dung was to be a component.
Horse’s dung, drunk in water, aided a woman in childbirth.—(“The
Poor Man’s Physician,” Edinburgh, 1716, p. 149.)</p>

<p>“Ut mulier post partum in secundis non laboret, de lotio hominis
subtiliter gustet et secundæ statim sequentur.”—(Sextus Placitus.)</p>

<p>Dioscorides prescribed both human ordure and the dung of the vulture
to bring about the expulsion of the fœtus.—(Materia Medica,
edition of Kuhn, vol. i. p. 232 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Goose-dung, in internal doses, was prescribed by Pliny for the same
purpose.—(Lib. 30, c. 4.)</p>

<p>But the dung of the elephant or menstrual blood prevented conception,
according to Avicenna: “Impregnationem prohibent ... stercus
elephantis,” vol. i. p. 390, b 11; “Impregnationem prohibent ... sanguis
menstruus, si supponatus.”—(Vol. i. pp. 330, a 35, 388, b 50.)</p>

<p>For accidents to pregnant women, apply rabbit’s dung externally;
for miscarriages, man’s urine, internally; the excreta of lionesses,
hawks, and chickens, internally; of horses and geese, externally and also
internally; and of pigeons and cows, externally. For after-birth pains,
the patient’s own urine, externally; or the excrement of chickens, internally.—(Paullini.)</p>

<p>Schurig recommended the use of lion-dung, internally, in cases of
difficult parturition.—(“Chylologia,” p. 819.)</p>

<p>Etmuller says of secundines: “In partu difficili nil est præstantius”
(p. 270).</p>

<p>Both Pliny and Hippocrates recommend hawk-dung in the treatment
of sterility, and to aid in the expulsion of the fœtus in childbirth; it
was to be drunk in wine; their prescription is copied by Etmuller:
“Hippocrates et Plinius ad sterilitatem emendandam propinant.”—(vol.
ii. p. 285.)</p>

<p>For the expulsion of the dead fœtus, Pliny recommended a fumigation
of horse-dung.—(Lib. xxviii. c. 77.)</p>

<p>And Sextus Placitus says: “Similiter, mortuum etiam partum ejicit.
Idem facit ut mulier facile pariat si totum corpus suffumigaveris claudit
et ventrem.”—(Cap. “De Equo.”)</p>

<p>Etmuller advises the use of these fumigations to aid in the expulsion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of the fœtus and after-birth; a potion of the dung should also be
administered in all such cases, being, in his opinion fully equal to the
dung of dogs or swallows.—(Vol. ii. p. 263.)</p>

<p>A parturient woman in New Hampshire, drank the urine of her husband
as a diuretic, forty or fifty years ago.—(Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen,
Cambridge, Massachusetts.)</p>

<p>Flemming is another who recommends a draught of the husband’s
urine to aid in delivery: “Porro, in partu difficili, urinam mariti calidam
calido haustam esse” (p. 23).</p>

<p>“A urine tub was held above the head of a woman in labor to ward
off all manner of evil influences.”—(Henry Rink, “Tales and Traditions
of the Eskimo,” Edinburgh, 1875, p. 55.)</p>

<p>“Gomez” (which is the “nirang” or urine of the ox) was prescribed
to be drunk as a purifying libation by a woman who had miscarried.
(See Fargard V. Avendidad, Zendavesta (Darmesteter’s translation), Max
Müller’s edition. “Sacred Books of the East,” Oxford, 1880, p. 62.)
“She shall drink gomez mixed with ashes, three cups of it, or six or
nine, to wash over the grave within her womb.... When three
nights have passed, she shall wash her body, she shall wash her
clothes, with gomez and with water by the nine holes, and thus shall
she be clean.”—(Idem, pp. 63, 90.)</p>

<p>“Avec une tendre sollicitude, les bonnes amies versent sur la tête de
la femme en travail le contenu d’un pot de chambre pour fortifier, disent-elles.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” Elie Réclus, p. 43; “Les Inoits Orientaux.”)</p>

<p>“The Commentaires of Bernard the Provincial, informs us” says
Daremberg, “that certain practices, not only superstitious but disgusting,
were common among the doctrines of Salerno; one, for
instance, was to eat themselves, and also to oblige their husbands to
eat, the excrements of an ass fried in a stove in order to prevent sterility.”—(“The
Physicians of the Middle Ages,” Minor, Cincinnati,
Ohio, p. 6, translated from Dupouy’s “Le Moyen Age Médical.”)</p>

<span class="smaller">INITIATION OF WARRIORS.—CONFIRMATION.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The attainment by young men of the age of manhood is an event
which among all primitive peoples has been signalized by peculiar
ceremonies; in a number of instances ordure and urine have been employed,
as for example: The observances connected with this event in
the lives of Australian warriors are kept a profound secret, but, among
the few learned is the fact that the neophyte is “plastered with goat
dung.”—(See “Aborigines of Australia,” A. Brough Smyth, London,
1878, vol. i. p. 59, footnote.)</p>

<p>In some parts of Australia, Smyth says that the youth of fourteen
or fifteen had to submit himself to the rite of “Tid-but,” during which
his head was shaved and plastered with mud (“the head is then
daubed with clay”) “and his body is daubed with clay, mud, and
charcoal-powder and filth of every kind.” (Smyth had previously
specified goat-dung.) “He carries a basket under his arm, containing
moist clay, charcoal, and filth.... He gathers filth as he goes, and
places it in the basket.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 60.)</p>

<p>The young initiate throws this filth at all the men he meets, but
not at the women or children, as these have been warned to keep out
of his way. This is the account given by Smyth, but Featherman, from
whom Smyth derived his information, makes no such restriction in his
text, simply stating that the young man was considered to be “excommunicated
<i>de facto</i>.” (See A. Featherman, “Social History of the
Races of Mankind,” 2d Division, London, 1887, p. 152.) But, in either
case, it is surely remarkable to stumble upon the counterpart of one
of the proceedings of the Feast of Fools in such a remote corner of the
globe.</p>

<p>“Among many of the tribes, the ceremony of introducing a native
into manhood, is said to be accompanied with some horrible and disgusting
practices.”—(“The Nat. Tribes of S. Australia,” Adelaide,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
1879, Introduction, xxviii, received through the kindness of the
Royal Soc. of Sydney, N. S. Wales, T. B. Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>“In order to infuse courage into boys, a warrior, Kerketegerkai,
would take the eye and tongue of a dead man (probably of a slain
enemy), and after mincing them and mixing with his urine, would administer
the compound in the following manner. He would tell the
boy to shut his eyes and not look, adding: ‘I give you proper kaikai’
(‘kaikai’ is an introduced word, being the jargon English for food).
The warrior then stood up behind the sitting youth, and putting the
latter’s hand between his (the man’s) legs, would feed him. After this
dose, ‘heart along, boy no fright.’”—(A. C. Haddon, “The Ethnography
of the Western Tribes of Torres Straits,” in Journal of the Anthrop.
Institute, Great Britain and Ireland, xix. no. 3, 1890, p. 420. Received
through the kindness of Professor H. C. Henshaw, U. S. Geol.
Survey, Washington, D. C.)</p>

<p>“Some other customs are altogether so obscene and disgusting I
must, even at the risk of leaving my subject incomplete, pass them over
by only thus briefly referring to them.”—(“Nat. Tr. of S. Australia,”
p. 280.)</p>

<p>Monier Williams repeats almost what Müller says about the Parsis.
A young Parsi undergoes a sort of confirmation, during which “he is
made to drink a small quantity of the urine of a bull.”—(“Modern
India,” London, 1878, p. 178.)</p>

<h3>FEARFUL RITE OF THE HOTTENTOTS.</h3>

<p>A religious rite of still more fearful import occurs among the same
people at the initiation of their young men into the rank of warriors—a
ceremony which must be deferred until the postulant has attained
his eighth or ninth year. It consists, principally, in depriving him of
the left testicle, after which the medicine man voids his urine upon
him.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“At eight or nine years of age, the young Hottentot is, with great
ceremony deprived of his left testicle.” (Kolbein, p. 402.) He says
nothing about an aspersion with urine in this instance, but on the
succeeding page he narrates that there is first a sermon from one of
the old men, who afterwards “evacuates a smoking stream of urine all
over him, having before reserved his water for that purpose. The
youth receives the stream with eagerness and joy; and making furrows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
with the long nails in the fat upon his body, rubs in the briny fluid
with the quickest action. The old man, having given him the last
drop, utters aloud the following benediction: ‘Good fortune attend
thee; live to old age. Increase and multiply. May thy beard grow
soon.’”—(Idem, p. 403.)</p>

<p>“The young Hottentot, who has won the reputation of a hero by
killing a lion, tiger, leopard, elephant, etc., is entitled to wear a bladder
in his hair; he is formally congratulated by all his kraal. One of the
medicine-men marches up to the hero and pours a plentiful stream over
him from head to foot,—pronouncing over him certain terms which I
could never get explained. The hero, as in other cases, rubs in the
smoking stream upon his face and every other part with the greatest
eagerness.”—(Idem, p. 404.)</p>

<p>Rev. Theophilus Hahn cites Kolbein in “Beiträge für Kunde der
Hottentoten,” in Jahrbuch für Erdkunde, von Dresden, 1870, p. 9,
as communicated by Dr. Gatchett of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington,
D. C. For further references to the Hottentot ceremony of
Initiation, by sprinkling the young warrior with urine, consult Pinkerton’s
“Voyages,” vol. xvi. pp. 89 and 141, where there is a quotation
from Thurnberg’s “Account of the Cape of Good Hope.” See also
Maltebrun, “Univ. Geog.” vol. ii. article “The Cape of Good Hope.”</p>

<p>The Indians of California gave urine to newly-born children. “At
time of childbirth, many singular observances obtained; for instance,
the old women washed the child as soon as it was born, and drank of
the water; the unhappy infant was forced to take a draught of urine
medicinally.”—(Bancroft, H. H. “Native Races,” vol. i. p. 413.)</p>

<p>Forlong states that at the time of investiture of the Indian boy with
the sacred thread, “the fire is kindled with the droppings of the
sacred cow.”—(“Rivers of Life,” London, 1883, vol. i. p. 323.)</p>

<p>Valuable information was also received from Mr. Edward Palmer, of
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, especially in regard to the Kalkadoon
tribe near Cloncurry, who are among those who split the urethra.</p>

<p>In order to bring up an Eskimo child to be an “Angerd-lartug-sick,”—that
is, “a man brought up in a peculiar manner, with a view to
acquiring a certain faculty by means of which he might be called to life
again and returned to land, in case he should be drowned,”—“for
this purpose the mother had to keep a strict fast and the child to be
accustomed to the smell of urine.”—(Rink, “Tales and Traditions of
the Eskimo,” p. 45.)</p>

<p>Réclus says of the Inuit child selected to be trained as an Angekok:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
“Sitôt née, la petite créature sera aspergée d’urine de manière à l’imprégner
de son odeur caractéristique; c’est décidément leur eau bénite.
Ailleurs, la barbe, la chevelure, l’entière personne des rois et sacrificateurs
sont ointes d’huile prise dans de saintes ampoules; ailleurs,
elles sont beurrées et barbouillées de bouse soigneusement étendue.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” p. 84, “Les Inoits Occidentaux.”)</p>

<p>For initiation in witchcraft, “Dans la Hesse, le postulant se place
sur du fumier en prononçant des formules magiques, et pique un crapaud
avec un bâton blanc qu’il jette ensuite à l’eau.”—(“La Fascination,”
J. Tuchmann, in “Mélusine,” Paris, July-August, 1890, p. 93.)</p>

<p>“I am strongly inclined to the belief that all these rites are survivals
or debased vestiges of the blood-covenant practice, by which the partaking
of each other’s selves (by whatever is a portion of one’s self) is
a form of covenanting by which two persons become as one. Are you
aware of the fact that the habit of giving the urine of a healthy child
to a new-born babe has prevailed down to the present day among rustic
nurses in New England, if not elsewhere, in America? I can bear
personal testimony to this fact from absolute knowledge. It is a noteworthy
fact that the Hebrew word <i>chaneek</i>, which is translated ‘trained’
or ‘initiated,’ and which is used in the proverb, ‘Train up a child,’ etc.,
has as its root-idea (as shown in the corresponding Arabic word) the
‘opening of the gullet’ in a new-born child, the starting the child in
its new life. Among some primitive peoples fresh blood, as added life,
is thus given to a babe; and in other cases it is urine.”—(Personal
letter from Rev. H. K. Trumbull, editor of the “Sunday-School Times,”
Philadelphia, April 19, 1888.)</p>

<p>“The priesthood of the false gods is hereditary in the family....
Others may be introduced into the corps of fetich priests, but they
have to pay dearly for the honor.... Every morning before sunrise
and every evening at sunset the aspirants were heard singing in choir,
directed by an old fetich priestess.” These ceremonies of consecration
“last several days.... The crinkled hair which is completely
shaved off of some, and only from the crown of the head of others,
the aspersion of lustral water, the imposition of the new name.”—(“Fetichism,”
Rev. P. Baudin, New York, 1885, pp. 74, 75.)</p>

<p>“One observer of the customs of the blacks has stated in the journal
of the Anthropological Society of London that in the Hunter River
District of New South Wales, the catechumens at some parts of the
Bora ceremonies are required to eat ordure; but I have made diligent
inquiries in the same locality and elsewhere, but have found nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
to corroborate his statement. Similarly, in one district in Queensland,
it is said that the blacks, whether at the Bora or not I cannot say,
make cup-like holes in the clay soil, collect their urine in them, and
drink it afterwards. This latter statement may be true, but I have
never been able to substantiate it by information from those who
know. Various considerations, however, lead me to think it possible
that our blacks, in some places at least (for their observances are not
everywhere the same), may use ordure and urine in that way, thinking
that the evil spirit will be propitiated by their eating in his honor that
which he himself delights to eat; just as in Northwestern India a devotee
may be seen going about with his body plastered all over with
human dung in honor of his god. And our blacks have good reason to
try to propitiate this unclean spirit (Gunungdhukhya) in every possible
way, for they believe that he can enter their bodies, and effecting
a lodgment in their abdomen, feed there on the foulest of the contents,
and thus cause cramps, fits, madness, and other serious disorders.
The non-Aryan population of India have similar beliefs; for among the
devil-worshippers of Western India there are certain malignant spirits
called Bhutas; and these in their habits are similar to Gunungdhukhya.
They too cause mischief by taking possession of the body, and
they delight to devour human beings; they too live in desert places,
especially among tall trees. They take the forms of men and animals,
and prowl about in burial-grounds, and eat the carcasses.”—(Personal
letter from John Frazer, LL.D., dated Sydney, New South Wales, December
24, 1889.)</p>

<p>This correspondent has struck the keynote of the curious behavior
of the prophet Ezekiel and others. Believing, as was believed in their
day, that deities ate excrement, why should not they, the representatives
of the gods, eat it too? And if a god enter into a man’s body to
eat excrement, why should not the victim feed him on that which is so
acceptable, and by gorging him free himself from pain?</p>

<p>See, under “War Customs,” the use of the drink <i>wysoccan</i> by the
Indians of Virginia, in their ceremonies of initiation.</p>

<p>See, under “Ordeals and Punishments,” page 254, in regard to the
belief of the Australians.</p>

<h3>WAR-CUSTOMS.—ARMS AND ARMOR.</h3>

<p>It is remarkable that we should be able to adduce any example of
the employment of excrementitious matter in war customs; not that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
we should not suspect their existence, but because on occasions of such
importance the medicine-men, who arrogate to themselves so much
consequence in all military affairs, would naturally be more careful
to conceal their performances from profane eyes. There is very little
reason to doubt that a fuller examination would be rewarded with new
facts of additional interest and value.</p>

<p>When the Dutch were besieging Batavia, in the Island of Java, in
1623, the natives daubed themselves with human ordure, in all likelihood
for some vague religious purpose,—“a 1629, in obsidione
Batavos obsessos, in defectu aliorum ad defensionem necessariorum
requisitorum hostes suos Indos stercore humano ex cloacis collecto,
ollisque in ipsorum nuda corpora conjecto, fugasse.”—(“Chylologia,”
p. 795.)</p>

<p>“Les Malais se servent de l’urine pour tremper leurs fameux criss.
Ils enfoncent ces poignards dans la terre, et pendant un certain temps,
ils viennent uriner de manière que cette terre soit toujours imbibée
d’urine.”—(Personal letter from Dr. Bernard, Cannes, France, dated
July 7, 1888.)</p>

<p>Against what was known in the Middle Ages as “magical impenetrability,”
human ordure was in high repute. The sword or “machete”
of the person exposed to attack from such an enemy should be rubbed
in pig-dung. But let Schurig tell his own story: “Scilicet, priusquam
cum adversario hujus rei suspecto congrediaris, cuspis machæræ vel
gladii, stercori suillo infigatur; vel si eminus agendum, globuli bomberdis
infarciendi per sphincterem ani ducantur; quod certissimum
dicitur antidotum contra hanc non minus quam Diaboli Incantationes.”—(“Chylologia,”
p. 791, par. 64.)</p>

<p>Frommann states that arms may be bewitched so that they can do
harm; but he makes no mention of human or animal excreta in such
connection.—(“Tract. de Fascinat.,” p. 654.)</p>

<p>“Dum gladio quo vulnus fuit inflictum sive cruento sive non cruento
applicatur unguentum quod vocant magneticum armarium quo curatur
vulnus.” (Etmuller, vol. i. p. 68.) This magnetic ointment was
made of human ordure and human urine.</p>

<p>See also page 298 of this volume.</p>

<p>“The Scythians prefer mares for the purposes of war, because they
can pass their urine without stopping in their career.”—(Pliny, lib.
viii. cap. 66.)</p>

<p>The “black drink” of the Creeks and Seminoles was an emetic and
cathartic of somewhat violent nature. It was used by the warriors of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
those tribes when about to start out on the war-path or engage in any
important deliberations.—(See Cornwallis Clay’s dissertation upon
the Seminoles of Florida, in “Annual Report of Bureau of Ethnology,”
Washington, D. C., 1888.)</p>

<p>The “black drink” of the Creeks was made from the Iris Versicolor
(Natural order, Iridacæa), “an active emeto-cathartic, abundant
in swampy grounds throughout the Southern States.”—(See Brinton,
“Myths of the New World,” New York, 1868, p. 274.)</p>

<p>Beverly mentions “a mad potion,” “the Wysoccan,” used by the
Indians of Virginia during “an initiatory ceremony called Huskansaw,
which took place every sixteen or twenty years,” which he calls “the
water of Lethe,” and by the use of which they “perfectly lose the
remembrance of all former things, even of their parents, their treasure,
and their language.”—(“Golden Bough,” vol. ii. p. 349, quoting Beverly’s
“History of Virginia,” London, 1722, p. 177.)</p>

<p>The African hunter in pursuit of game, such as elephants, anoints
himself “all over with their dung.”—(Father Merolla, in Pinkerton,
vol. xvi. p. 251, “Voyage to Congo.”) This, he says, is merely
to deceive the animal with the smell.</p>

<p>Pliny relates that in Heraklea the country-people poisoned panthers
with aconite. But the panthers had sense enough to know that human
excrement was an antidote. (Lib. xxviii. c. 2.) Again in lib.
viii. c. 41 he tells of the aconite-poisoned panther curing itself by
eating human excrement. Knowing this fact, the peasants suspend
human excrement in a pot so high in the air that the panther exhausts
itself in jumping to reach it, and dies all the sooner.</p>

<p>Schurig (“Chylologia,” p. 774) has the above tale, but has taken it
from Claudius Æmilianus, as well as Pliny.</p>

<p>The reindeer Tchuktchi feign to be passing urine in order to catch
their animals which they want to use with their sleds. The reindeer,
horses, and cattle of the Siberian tribes are very fond of urine, probably
on account of the salt it contains, and when they see a man
walking out from the hut, as if for the purpose of relieving his bladder,
they follow him up, and so closely that he finds the operation anything
but pleasant.</p>

<p>“The Esquimaux of King William’s Land and the adjacent peninsula
often catch the wild reindeer by digging a pit in the deep snow, and
covering it with thin blocks of snow, that would break with the weight
of an animal. They then make a line of urine from several directions,
leading to the centre of the cover of the pitfall, where an accumulation
of snow, saturated with the urine of the dog, is deposited as bait.
One or more animals are thereby led to their destruction.”—(Personal
letter from the Arctic explorer, W. H. Gilder, dated New York,
October 15, 1889.)</p>

<p>“The dogs of the Esquimaux are equally fond of excrement, especially
in cold weather, and when a resident of the Arctic desires to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
relieve himself, he finds it necessary to take a whip or a stick to
defend himself against the energy of the hungry dogs. Often, when
a man wants to urge his dog-team to greater exertion, he sends his
wife or one of the boys to run ahead, and when at a distance, to stoop
down and make believe he is relieving himself. The dogs are thus
spurred to furious exertion, and the boy runs on again, to repeat the
delusion. This never fails of the desired effect, no matter how often
repeated.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“I only know one superstitious use of excrement,—that wherein
the hooks were placed round some before the fishing incantations
began.” (“The Maoris of New Zealand,” E. Tregear, in “Journal of
the Anthrop. Institute,” London, 1889.) This bears a very close
resemblance to certain of the uses of cow-dung in India.</p>

<p>The people of Angola, west coast of Africa, when about to set out
on a hunt, are careful to collect the dung of the elephant, antelope,
and other kinds of wild animals, and hand them to the medicine-man,
who makes a magical compound out of them, and places it in a
horn. It then serves as an amulet, and will ensure success in the
hunt.—(“Muhongo,” an African boy from Angola; interpretation
made by Rev. Mr. Chatelain.)</p>

<span class="smaller">DIVINATION.—OMENS.—DREAMS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Among the ancients there was a method of divination by excrementitious
materials.—(See “Scatomancie,” in Bib. Scat. p. 28.)</p>

<p>“Gaule, in his ‘Mag-Astromancers Posed and Puzzled’ (p. 165),
enumerates as follows the several species of divination.” (Here follows
a list of fifty-three kinds.) One of the kinds enumerated is
“Spatalomancy, by skin, bones, excrement.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.,”
pp. 329, 330.)</p>

<p>In the “Rhudhiradhyaya, or Sanguinary Chapter,” translated from
the Calica Puran, in the 4th vol. “Asiatic Researches,” 4th ed.,
London, 1807, the following is stated in regard to human victims:
“If, at the time of presenting the blood, the victim discharges fæces
or urine, or turns about, it indicates certain death to the sacrificer.”</p>

<p>The Peruvians had one class of wizards (i. e., medicine-men) who
“told fortunes by maize and the dung of sheep.”—(“Fables and
Rites of the Yncas,” Padre Cristoval de Molina, translated by Clement
C. Markham, Hakluyt Society Transactions, London, 1873, vol. xlviii.,
p. 14. Molina resided in Cuzco, as a missionary, from 1570 to 1584.)</p>

<p>“Les Hachus (a division of the Peruvian priesthood) consultaient
l’avenir au moyen de grains de maïs ou des excréments des animaux.”—(Balboa,
“Histoire de Pérou,” p. 29, in Ternaux, vol. xv.)</p>

<p>See, also, D. G. Brinton’s “Myths of the New World,” New York,
1868, pp. 278, 279.</p>

<p>Ducange, enumerating the pagan superstitions which still survived
in Europe in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 743, mentions divination or augury by the dung of
horses, cattle, or birds: “De auguriis vel avium, vel equorum, vel
boum stercoracibus.”—(Ducange, Glossary, article “Stercoraces.”)</p>

<p>“What wise man would think that God would commit his counsel
to a dog, an owle, a swine, or a toade; or that he would hide his
secret purposes in the dung or bowels of beastes?” Reg. Scot (“Discoverie,”
p. 150), speaking of the omens consulted by Spaniards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
English, and others, says: “Among the rustics of France, to dream of
ordure was regarded as a sign of good luck; in like manner, to have
a ball, or anything that one carried in the hand, fall in ordure, was
also a sign of good fortune.”</p>

<p>“To dream of ordure means that somebody is going to try to bewitch
you.”—(“Muhongo,” a boy from Angola, Eastern Africa, in
conversation with Captain Bourke; translation by Rev. Mr. Chatelain.)</p>

<p>This belief in the good or bad prognostications to be derived from
dreams about ordure, was very widely disseminated. “Luck, or Good
Luck. To tread in Sir Reverence; to be bewrayed; an allusion to
the proverb, ‘Sh-tt-n luck is good luck.’”—(“Grose, Dict. of Buckish
Slang,” London, 1811.)</p>

<p>“Inasmuch as the sun of morning, or spring, comes out of the dark-blue
bird of night, we can understand the popular Italian and German
superstition, that when the excrement of a bird falls upon a man it is
an omen of good luck. The excrement of the mythical bird of night,
or winter, is the sun.”—(“Zoöl. Mythol.,” Angelo de Gubernatis,
vol. ii. p. 176, London, 1872.)</p>

<p>“When a Hindu child’s horoscope portends misfortune or crime, he
is born again from a cow, thus: being dressed in scarlet, and tied on a
new sieve, he is passed between the hind legs of a cow, forward
through the fore legs to the mouth, and again in the reverse direction,
to simulate birth; the ordinary birth ceremonies (aspersion, etc.) are
then gone through, and the father smells his son as a cow smells her
calf.”—(Frazer, “Totemism,” Edinburgh, 1887, p. 33.)</p>

<p>To put one’s foot in dung is supposed by the French peasantry to
imply the acquirement of wealth.—(Mr. W. W. Rockhill.)</p>

<p>Among the Kamtchatkans, if a child has been born in stormy
weather, they believe that to be a bad omen, and that the child will
cause storm and rain wherever it goes. As soon as it is grown and
can speak, they purify it, and appease heaven by the following method:
During a most violent storm of wind and rain, the child is compelled
to walk naked, holding a cup or shell of Mytues high above its head,
around the ostrag and all balagans and dog huts, and to say the following
prayer to Billukai and his Kamuli: “Gsaulga, set yourselves
down and stop urinating or storming; this shell is used to salty but
not to sweet water; you make me very wet, and I almost freeze to
death; besides, I have no clothing; see how I tremble.”—(Steller,
translated by Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>Divination by urine seems to have been superseded by holy water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
in a “chrystall.” Scot, speaking of the latter mode, says: “They
take a glass vial, full of holy water, ... on the mouth of the vial or
urinall,” etc.—(“Discoverie,” p. 188.)</p>

<p>There is among children in the United States and England, and possibly
on the continent of Europe as well, a superstition to the effect
that the one who plucks the dandelion will become addicted to the
habit of urinating in bed during sleep. The author has been unable
to trace the origin of the curious notion or to obtain any explanation
of it.</p>

<p>“Leontodon. Dandelion. Children that eat it in the evening experience
its diuretic effects in the night, which is the reason that other
European nations as well as the British vulgarly call it piss-a-bed.”—(Encyclopædia,
Philadelphia, Penn., 1797, article “Leontodon.”)</p>

<p>“The following compendious new way of magical divination, which
we find so humorously described in Butler’s ‘Hudibras’ as follows, is
affirmed by M. Le Blanc, in his ‘Travels,’ to be used in the East
Indies:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 331, article “Divination.”)</p>

<p>Cicero makes no mention of a method of divination by excrement,
although, as shown by the references from the “Bib. Scat.” and from
Ducange, such methods must have been in vogue.</p>

<p>The Kamtchatkans believe that “if they ease nature during
sleep, it signifies guests of their nation.”—(Steller, translated by
Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>Montfaucon says that the Roman Haruspices “observed in the
beasts that were sacrificed not only the entrails in general, but also
the gall and bladder in particular.”—(“L’Antiquité expliquée,” lib. i.
part 1, cap. 6.)</p>

<span class="smaller">ORDEALS AND PUNISHMENTS, TERRESTRIAL AND SUPERNAL.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In beginning this chapter it is fair to say that oaths will herein be
regarded as a modified form of the ancient ordeal, in which the
affiant invokes upon himself, if proved to have sworn falsely, the tortures
of the ordeal, mundane or celestial, which in an older form of
civilization he would have been obliged to undergo as a preliminary
trial.</p>

<p>The author learned while campaigning against the Sioux and Cheyennes,
in 1876-1877, that the Sioux and Assinaboines had a form of
oath sworn to while the affiant held in each hand a piece of buffalo
chip.</p>

<p>Among the Hindus, “sometimes the trial was confined to swallowing
the water in which the priest had bathed the image of one of the
divinities.... The negroes of Issyny dare not drink the water into
which the fetiches have been dipped when they affirm what is not the
truth.”—(“Phil. of Magic,” Eusèbe Salverte, New York, 1862, vol. ii.
p. 123.)</p>

<p>They formerly may have drunk the urine of the god or priest.</p>

<p>In “the ‘Domesday Survey,’ in the account of the city of Chester,
vol. i. p. 262, we read: ‘Vir sive mulier falsam mensuram in civitate
faciens deprehensus, IIII solid. emendab. Similiter malam cervisiam
faciens, aut in Cathedra ponebatur stercoris, aut IIII solid. de prepotis.’”—(Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 103, article “Ducking
Stool.”)</p>

<p>“The ducking stool was a legal punishment. Roguish brewers and
bakers were also liable to it, and they were to be ducked in stercore
in the town ditch.”—(Southey, “Commonplace Book,” 1st series,
p. 401, London, 1849.)</p>

<p>In Loango, Africa, “When a man is suspected of an offence he is
carried before the king,” and “is compelled to drink an infusion of a
kind of root called ‘imbando.’ ... The virtue of this root is that, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
they put too much into the water, the person that drinketh it cannot
void urine.... The ordeal consists in drinking and then in urinating
as a proof of innocence.”—(See “Adv. of Andrew Battell,” in Pinkerton’s
“Voyages,” vol. xvi. p. 334.)</p>

<p>In Sierra Leone the natives have a curious custom to which they
subject all of their tribe suspected of poisoning. They make the culprit
drink a certain “red water; after which for twenty-four hours he is
not allowed to ease nature by any evacuation; and should he not be
able to restrain them, it would be considered as strong a proof of his
guilt as if he had fallen a victim to the first draught.”—(Lieutenant
John Matthews, R. N., “Voyage to Sierra Leone,” 1785, London, 1788,
p. 126.)</p>

<p>In the Hindu mythology, “slanderers and calumniators, stretched
upon beds of red-hot iron, shall be obliged to eat excrements.”—(Southey,
“Commonplace Book,” 1st series, London, 1849, p. 249.
He also refers to 2 Kings xviii. 27, and to Isaiah xxxvi. 12.)</p>

<p>“D’après le système religieux de Brahme, la punition des calomniateurs
dans l’enfer, consiste à être nourris d’excréments.”—(Majer.
Dict. Mythol. en Allemagne, t. 2, p. 46; Bib. Scat., p. 12.)</p>

<p>Herodotus relates that Pheron, the son of Sesostris, conqueror of
Egypt, became blind, and remained so for ten years.</p>

<p>“But in the eleventh year an oracle reached him from the city of
Buto, importing that the time of his punishment was expired, and he
should recover his sight by washing his eyes with the urine of a woman
who had intercourse with her own husband only, and had known no
other man.” Herodotus goes on to relate that Pheron tried the urine
of his own wife and that of many other women ineffectually; finally he
was cured by the urine of a woman whom he took to wife; all the
others he burnt to death.—(“Euterpe,” part ii. cap. 3.)</p>

<p>In the “Histoire Secrète du Prince Croq’ Étron,” par M’lle Laubert,
Paris, 1790, King Petaud orders Prince Gadourd to be buried
alive in ordure,—a punishment which would have suggested the author’s
acquaintance with Brahminical literature even had she not confessed
it in these terms: “Genre de supplice qui n’était pas nouveau
puisque d’après le système religieux de Brahme, la punition des calomniateurs
dans l’enfer, consiste à être nourri d’excréments.”</p>

<p>The Africans have an ordeal,—“a superstitious ordeal, by drinking
the poisonous Muave,” which induces vomiting only, according to
Livingston (“Zambesi,” London, 1865, p. 120). This may or may not
be the “red drink” of Lieutenant Matthews cited above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>Under the head of “Latrines,” allusion has been made to the prohibition,
in the laws of the Thibetan Buddhists, against throwing ordure
upon growing plants, etc. There is another case mentioned by Rockhill,
which may as well be inserted here: “Si une bhikshuni jette des
excréments de l’autre côté d’un mur sans y avoir regardé, c’est un pacittiya.”—(“Pratimoksha
Sutra,” translated by W. W. Rockhill, Soc.
Asiatique, Paris, 1885.)</p>

<p>In the words just quoted we find the definition of the offence as a
“pacittiya,” or sin. The punishment for each sin or class of sins was
carefully regulated and well understood in Thibetan nunneries.</p>

<p>“Cock-stool.” “A seat of ignominy ... in which scolding or immoral
women used to be placed formerly as a punishment; ... same
as ‘sedes Stercoraria.’”—(“Folk-Etymology,” Rev. A. Smythe-Palmer,
London, 1882. See also Chambers’s “Book of Days,” vol. i. p. 211.)</p>

<p>The Chinese have a very curious and very horrible mode of punishment;
criminals of certain classes are enclosed in barrels or boxes
filled with building lime, and exposed in a public street to the rays
of the noon-day sun; food in plenty is within reach of the unfortunate
wretches, but it is salt fish, or other salt provision, with all the
water needed to satisfy the thirst this food is certain to excite, but
in the very alleviation of which the poor criminals are only adding
to the torments to overtake them when by a more copious discharge
from the kidneys the lime shall “quicken” and burn them to death.</p>

<p>In the famous bull of Ernulphus, Bishop of Rochester, cited in “Tristram
Shandy,” the delinquent was to be cursed, “mingendo, cacando.”—(See
“Tristram Shandy,” Lawrence Sterne, ed. of London, 1873,
vol. i. p. 188.)</p>

<p>“Fasting on bread and drinking water defiled by the excrement of
a fowl” are among the disciplinary punishments cited in Fosbroke’s
“Monachism,” London, 1817, p. 308, note.</p>

<p>This specimen of monastic discipline may be better understood when
read between the lines. The veneration surrounding chicken-dung in
the religious system of the Celts, prior to the introduction of the
Christian religion, could be uprooted in no more complete manner than
by making its use a matter of scorn and contempt; history is replete
with examples wherein we are taught that the things which are held
most sacred in one cult are the very ones upon which the fury and
scorn of the superseding cultus are wreaked. On this point read the
notes taken from the pamphlet of Mr. James Mooney, in regard to the
superstitions attaching to the uses of chicken-dung among the Irish
peasantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“I have mentioned the sacrifice of cocks by Kelts; it was, and still
is, all over Asia, the cheap, common, and very venial substitute for
man.”—(“Rivers of Life,” Forlong, London, 1883, vol. ii. p. 274.)</p>

<p>We may reasonably infer that the dung of chickens as used by the
Irish is a representative of, and a substitute for, human ordure.</p>

<p>The Easter season which has preserved and transmitted to our times
so many pagan usages, has among its superstitions one to the effect
that “every person must have some part of his dress new on Easter
day, or he will have no good fortune that year. Another saying is
that unless that condition be fulfilled, the birds are likely to spoil your
clothes.”—(Brand, “Pop. Antiq.” vol. i. p. 165, art. “Easter Day.”)</p>

<p>The Kalmucks believe in many places of future punishment, one of
them being “un de ces séjours est couvert d’une nuée d’ordures et de
vidanges.” (Pallas, Paris, 1793, vol. i. p. 552.) This is the belief
inculcated by their Lamas.</p>

<p>At the Lithuanian festival called “Sabarios,” fowls were killed and
eaten. “The bones were then given to the dog to eat; if he did not
eat them all up, the remains were buried under the dung in the cattle-stall.”—(“The
Golden Bough,” vol. ii. p. 70.)</p>

<p>In cases of sickness “the inhabitants of a village are forbidden to
wash themselves for a number of days, ... and to clean their chamber-pots
before sun-rise.”—(“The Central Eskimo,” Dr. Franz Boas,
in Sixth An. Rep. Bur. of Ethnol. Wash. D. C. 1888, p. 593.)</p>

<p>“We have seen that in modern Europe, the person who cuts or binds
or threshes the last sheaf is often exposed to rough treatment at the
hands of his fellow-laborers. For example, he is bound up in the last
sheaf and thus encased is carried or carted about, beaten, drenched with
water, thrown on a dunghill, etc.”—(“The Golden Bough,” i. 367.)</p>

<p>In several parts of Germany, the Fool of the Carnival was buried
under a dung-heap. (Idem, vol. i. p. 256.) Further on, is given this
explanation: “The burying of the representative of the Carnival under
a dung-heap is natural, if he is supposed to possess a quickening and
fertilizing influence like that ascribed to the effigy of Death.”—(Idem,
vol. i. p. 270.)</p>

<p>“In Siam it was formerly the custom, on one day of the year, to
single out a woman broken down by debauchery, and carry her on a
litter through all the streets, to the music of drums and hautboys.
The mob insulted her and pelted her with dirt; and, after having carried
her through the whole city, they threw her on a dunghill....
They believed that the woman thus drew upon herself all the malign
influences of the air and of evil spirits.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 196.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>In Suabia there is a rough harvest game in which one of the laborers
takes the part of the sow; he is pursued by his comrades and if
they catch him “they handle him roughly, beating him, blackening or
dirtying his face, throwing him into filth.... At other times he is
put in a wheelbarrow.... After being wheeled round the village, he
is flung on a dunghill.”—(Idem, vol. ii. pp. 27, 28.)</p>

<p>The negroes of Guinea are firm believers in the theory of Obsession,
and have a god “Abiku” who “takes up his abode in the human
body.” He generally bothers little children, who sometimes die. “If
the child dies, the body is thrown on the dirt-heap to be devoured
by wild beasts.”—(“Fetichism,” Baudin, p. 57.)</p>

<p>“The Iroquois inaugurated the new year in January” with “a festival
of dreams.... It was a time of general license.... Many seized
the opportunity of paying off old scores by belaboring obnoxious persons,
... covering them with filth and hot ashes.”—(“The Golden
Bough,” vol. ii. p. 165, quoting Charlevoix, “La Nouvelle France.”)</p>

<p>“During the madder harvest in the Dutch province of Zealand, a
stranger passing by a field where the people are digging the madder
roots, ‘will sometimes call out to them, Koortspillers’ (a term of reproach).
Upon this, two of the fleetest runners make after him, and
if they catch him, they bring him back to the madder field and bury
him in the earth up to his middle at least, jeering at him all the while;
they then ease nature before his face.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 379.)</p>

<p>“Now, it is an old superstition that by easing nature on the spot
where a robbery is committed, the robbers secure themselves for a
certain time against interruption.... The fact, therefore, that the
madder-diggers resort to this proceeding in presence of the stranger
proves that they consider themselves robbers and him as the person
robbed.”—(Idem, p. 380.)</p>

<p>In connection with the above, the following deserves consideration:
“Reverence. An ancient custom which obliges any person easing himself
near the highway or footpath, on the word ‘reverence’ being given
him by a passenger, to take off his hat with his teeth, and, without
moving from his station, to throw it over his head, by which it frequently
falls into the excrement. This was considered as a punishment
for the breach of delicacy. A person refusing to obey this law
might be pushed backwards. Hence, perhaps, the term ‘sir-reverence.’”—(Grose,
“Dict. of Buckish Slang.”)</p>

<p>It is more likely that the practice had some connection with the
fear of witchcraft, or the evil eye of the stranger; we can hardly credit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
that peasantry living in an age when the highest classes received their
guests at bedside receptions, “ruelles,” or in their “cabinets d’aisance,”
would be squeamish in the trifling matter just alluded to.</p>

<p>In Japan “When any of these panders die ... their bodies are
cast upon a dunghill.”—(John Saris, in Purchas, i. 368, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1611.)</p>

<p>“The tricks of the fayry called Pach.” “I smurch her face if it be
cleane, but if it be durty, I wash it in the next pisse-pot I can finde.”—(“Life
of Robin Goodfellow,” Black Letter, London, 1628, in Hazlitt’s
“Fairy Tales,” London, 1875, p. 205.)</p>

<p>But the “women fayries,” under similar circumstances, “wash their
faces and hands with a gilded child’s clout.”—(Idem, p. 206.)</p>

<p>“Their own spirits too will have nothing but excrement to eat, if
during life the rites of the Bora (Initiation) have not been duly performed.
With this compare the declaration of the Indian Manes (xii.
71) that a Kahatya who has not done his duty, will, after death, have
to live on ordure and carrion. And in the Melanesian Hades the
ghosts of the wicked have nothing to eat but vile refuse and excrement.”—(Personal
Letter from John Frazer, LL.D., to Captain Bourke,
dated Sydney, New South Wales, Dec. 24, 1889.)</p>

<p>The Australians believed that if a man did not allow the septum of
the nose to be pierced, he would suffer in the next world. “As soon
as ever the spirit Egowk left the body, it would be required, as a punishment,
to eat Toorta-gwannang” (filth not proper for translation).—(“Aborigines
of Victoria,” Smyth, vol. i. p. 274.)</p>

<p>Among some of the Australian tribes is found a potent deity named
“Pund-jel,” whom Mr. Andrew Lang thinks may be the Eagle-Hawk.
“As a punisher of wicked people, Pund-jel was once moved to drown
the world, and this he did by a flood which he produced (as Dr. Brown
says of another affair) by a familiar Gulliverian application of hydraulics.”—(“Myth,

<p>“Forbearance from meat and work are also prescribed to a single
woman in case the sun or moon (though we should rather call it a bird
flying by) should let any uncleanness drop upon her; otherwise, she
might be unfortunate, or even deprived of her life.”—(Crantz, “History
of Greenland,” London, 1767, vol. i. p. 216.)</p>

<p>The “bitter water” of the Hebrew ordeals by which the woman accused
of unfaithfulness was either proved innocent, or had her belly
burst upon drinking, presents itself in this connection.—(See Numbers
v.)</p>

<p>Dante, in his cap. xiii. speaks of those condemned for flattery: “a
crowd immersed in ordure.”—(Cary’s translation.)</p>

<p>Ducange alludes to what may have been an ordeal or a punishment:
“Aquam sordidam et stercoratem super sponsam jactare.”—(“In Lege
Longobardi,” lib. i. tit. 16, c. 8.)</p>

<p>The Hebrew prophets sat on dungheaps while the recalcitrant people
of Israel were warned: “Behold, I will spread dung upon your
faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts, and one shall take you away
with it.”—(Malachi ii. 3.)</p>

<p>By reference to another portion of this volume, it will be seen that
stercoraceous matter was deemed potent in frustrating witchcraft.
Thus a mother was ordered to throw a “changeling” child upon a dunghill
(p. 403.) The prostitutes of Amsterdam kept horse-dung in
their houses for good luck, etc. Consequently, when we read of the
corpses of criminals or witches having been thrown upon dunghills, we
may let fancy indulge the idea that it was to render nugatory any
schemes the ghost might cherish of wreaking revenge.</p>

<p>Among the unlawful acts for Brahmans or Kshatriyas who are compelled

and charitable gifts, he will be born again as a worm, and together with

<span class="smaller">INSULTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It is somewhat singular to find in the myths of the Zuñis—the
very people among whom we have discovered the existence of this
filthy rite of urine-drinking—an allusion to the fact that to throw
urine upon persons or near their dwellings was to be looked upon as an
insult of the gravest character. During the early winter of 1881 the
author was at the Pueblo of Zuñi, New Mexico, while Mr. Frank H.
Cushing was engaged in the researches which have since placed him at
the head of American anthropologists, and then heard recited by the
old men the long myth of the young boy who went to the Spirit Land
to seek his father. One of the incidents upon which the story-tellers
dwelt with much insistence was the degradation and ignominy in
which the boy and his poor mother lived in their native village, as was
shown by the fact that their neighbors were in the habit of emptying
their urine vessels upon their roof and in front of their door.</p>

<p>The threat made against the Jews by Sennacherib (in Isaiah xxxvi.
12) deserves consideration in this connection; and also the threat in
the Old Testament, “There shall not be left one that pisses against
the wall.”</p>

<p>“Connected with the Samoan wars, several other things may be
noted, such as consulting the gods, ... haranguing each other previous
to a fight, the very counterpart of Abijah, King of Judah, and
even word for word with the filthy-tongued Rabshakeh.”—(“Samoa,”
Turner, p. 194.)</p>

<p>The people of Samoa have a myth relating a separation which occurred
between the natives of several islands, due to the fact that the
men and women living on Tutuaila “began to make a dunghill of their
floating island.”—(Olosenga, idem, p. 225.)</p>

<p>“Nebuchadnezzar likewise gave Zedekiah (after he had made him
dance and play before him a long while) a laxative drink, so that, like
a beastly old fellow (as there are many such betwixt York and London),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
<i>totus deturpatus fuit</i>, he smelt as ill as your Ajax.” In a marginal
reference, he adds: “According to an old ballad,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘And all to b⸺n was he, was he.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—(Harington, “Ajax,” p. 35.)</p>

<p>This behavior, disgusting as it appears to us in all its features, had
its parallel in the conduct of a prominent member of European aristocracy,
who was wont to indulge his anger in a manner strikingly similar
to the above at such moments as seemed to be proper for the punishment
of his servants. His name is suppressed at the request of the
correspondent furnishing the item.</p>

<p>Niebuhr says that the grossest insult that can be offered to a man,
especially a Mahometan, in Arabia, is to spit upon his beard, or to
say “De l’ordure sur ta barbe.”—(“Desc. de l’Arabie,” Amsterdam,
1774, p. 26.)</p>

<p>Niebuhr’s remarks in regard to the offence taken by the Bedouins at
such an infraction of their etiquette as flatulence are repeated in a
vague and guarded form by Maltebrun (“Univ. Geog.,” vol. ii. part
“Arabia”).</p>

<p>In Angola, Africa, the greatest insult is, “Go and eat s—t.”—(Muhongo.)</p>

<p>“Dunghill. A coward. A cock-pit phrase, all but gamecocks being
styled dunghills.”—(Grose, “Dictionary of Slang,” London, 1811.)</p>

<p>Tailors who accepted the wages prescribed by law were styled
“Dung” by the “Flints,” who refused them.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Among the rough games of English sailors was one, “The Galley,”
in which a mopful of excrement was thrust in a landsman’s face.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>In Angola, Africa, flatulence is freely permitted among the natives;
but any license of this kind taken while strangers are in the vicinity is
regarded as a deadly insult.—(“Muhongo,” translated by Rev. Mr.
Chatelain.)</p>

<p>In the report of one of the early American explorations to the Trans-Missouri
region occurs the story that the Republican Pawnees, Nebraska,
once (about 1780-90) violated the laws of hospitality by seizing a
calumet-bearer of the Omahas who had entered their village, and,
among other indignities, making him “drink urine mixed with bison
gall.”—(“Long’s Expedition,” Philadelphia, 1823, vol. i. p. 300.)</p>

<p>Bison gall itself sprinkled upon raw liver, just warm from the carcass,
was regarded as a delicacy. The expression “excrement eater”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
is applied by the Mandans and others on the Upper Missouri as a term
of the vilest opprobrium, according to Surgeon Washington Matthews,
U. S. Army (author of “Hidatsa,” and other ethnological works of
authority), whose remarks are based upon an unusually extended and
intelligent experience.</p>

<p>“They gave me the abuse of the Punjabi, ... pelting me with
sticks and cow-dung till I fell down and cried for mercy.”—(“Gemini,”
Rudyard Kipling, in “Soldiers Three,” New York, 1890.)</p>

<p>“May the garbage of the foundations of the city be thy food; may
the drains of the city be thy drink.”—(“The Chaldean Account of
Genesis,” George Smith, New York, 1880.)</p>

<p>Among the Cheyenne expressions of contempt is to be found one
which recalls the objurgations of the Bedouins; namely, <i>natsi-viz</i>, or
“s—t-mouth.”—(Personal notes of September 25, 1878, interview
with the chiefs of the Northern Cheyennes, Ben Clark, interpreter.)</p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, who has made such prolonged and careful
studies of the manners and myths of the tribes of the Siouan stock,
is authority for the statement that the worst insult that one Ponca
can give another is to say, “You are an eater of dog-dung;” and it
is noticeable that the words of the expression are rarely used in
the language of every-day life. He gives other examples from myths,
etc., and supplies a variant of the story narrated by Captain Long;
but as all this is to appear in one of the Doctor’s coming books, it is
omitted from these pages.</p>

<p>The Kamtchatkans say, “May you have one hundred burning lamps
in your podex,” “Eater of fæces with his fish-spawn,” etc.—(Steller,
translated by Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>“Stercus.” As a term of abuse.—“Nolo stercus curiæ dici Glauciam.”—(Cicero,
“De Oratoribus,” 3, 41, 164; Andrew’s “Latin
Dictionary,” New York, 1879, article “Stercus.”)</p>

<p>Caracalla put to death those who made water in front of his
statues. “Damnati sunt eo tempore (that is, the end of his wars with
the Germans) qui urinam in eo loco ferrant in quo statuæ aut imagines
erant principis.”—(Ælius Lampridius, “Life of the Emperor Caracalla,”
edition of Frankfort, 1588, p. 186, lines 43 and 44.)</p>

<p>There are some very singular laws of the ancient Burgundians in
regard to abusive words. “Si quis alterum concagatum clamaverit,
120 denariis mulctetur.”—(Barrington, “Obs. on the Statutes,” London,
1775, p. 315.)</p>

<p>“Again the coarsest word, <i>khara</i>. The allusion is to the vulgar
saying, ‘Thou eatest skitel’ (that is, ‘Thou talkest nonsense’). Decent
English writers modify this to ‘Thou eatest dirt;’ and Lord Beaconsfield
made it ridiculous by turning it into ‘eating sand.’”—(“Arabian
Nights,” Burton’s edition, vol. ii. pp. 222, 223.)</p>

<p>Readers of classical history will recall the incident of the outrage
perpetrated by the mob of Tarentum upon the person of the Roman
ambassador Posthumus, 282 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> A buffoon in the street threw filth
upon his toga. The ambassador refused to be mollified, and tersely
telling his assailants that many a drop of Tarentine blood would be
required to wash out the stains, took out his departure. A cruel war
followed, and the Tarentines were reduced to the rank of a conquered
province.—(See “History of Rome,” Victor Duruy, English translation,
Boston, 1887, vol. i. p. 462.)</p>

<p>“When the multitude had come to Jerusalem, to the feast of unleavened
bread, and the Roman cohort stood over the temple, ...
one of the soldiers pulled back his garment, and stooping down after
an indecent manner, turned his posteriors to the Jews, and spake such
words as might be expected upon such a posture.” The narration describes
the riot which followed as a result, and ten thousand people
were killed.—(See Josephus, “Wars of the Jews,” book ii. edition of
New York, 1821.)</p>

<p>The dispute between Richard the Lion-Hearted and the Arch-Duke
of Austria, which resulted afterwards in the incarceration of the English
king in a dungeon, had its rise in the great insult of throwing the
Austrian standard down into a privy. Matthew of Paris says distinctly
that Richard himself did this. “Now he, being over well disposed to
the cause of the Norman, waxed wroth with the Duke’s train, and gave
a headstrong, unseemly order for the Duke’s banner to be cast into a
cesspool.”—(See “The Third Crusade and Richard the First,” T. A.
Archer, in “English History from Contemporary Writers,” New York,
1889.)</p>

<p>“‘Khara,’ meaning dung, is the lowest possible insult. ‘Ta-kara’ is
the commonest of insults, used also by modest women. I have heard
a mother use it to her son.”—(Burton, “Arabian Nights,” vol. ii.

<span class="smaller">MORTUARY CEREMONIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>A Parsi is defiled by touching a corpse. “And when he is in
contact and does not move it, he is to be washed with bull’s
urine and water.”—(“Shapast la Shayast,” cap. 2.; “Sacred Books
of the East,” Max Müller, editor, Oxford, 1880, pp. 262, 269, 270, 272,
273, 279, 281, 282, 333, 349.)</p>

<p>In the cremation of a Hindu corpse at Bombay, the ashes of the
pyre were sprinkled with water, a cake of cow-dung placed in the
centre, and around it a small stream of cow-urine; upon this were
placed plantain-leaves, rice-cakes, and flowers.—(“Modern India,”
Monier Williams, p, 65.)</p>

<p>“They who return from the funeral must touch the stone of Priapus,
a fire, the excrement of a cow, a grain of sesame, and water,—all
symbols of that fecundity which the contact with a corpse might have
destroyed.”—(“Zoöl. Mythol.,” De Gubernatis, p. 49.)</p>

<p>The followers of Zoroaster were enjoined to pull a dead body out of
the water. “No sin attaches to him for any bone, hair, grass, flesh,
dung, or blood that may drop back into the water.”—(Fargard VI.,
Vendidad, Zendavesta, Darmesteter’s edition; Max Müller’s edition of
the “Sacred Books of the East,” Oxford, 1880, p. 70.)</p>

<p>“There dies a man in the depths of the vale; a bird takes flight
from the top of the mountain down into the depths of the vale, and it
eats up the corpse of the dead man there; then up it flies from
the depths of the vale to the top of the mountain; it flies to some
one of the trees there,—of the hard-wooded or the soft-wooded, and
upon that tree it vomits, it deposits dung, it drops pieces from the
corpse.... If a man chop any of that wood for a fire, he is not
regarded as defiled because ... Ahura-Mazda answered, ‘There is no
sin upon any man for any dead matter that has been brought by dogs,
by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies.’”—(Fargard V., of same
work.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>If a dog had died on a piece of ground, the ground had to lie fallow
for a year; at the end of that time, “they shall look on the ground
for any bones, hair, flesh, dung, or blood that may be there.”—(Fargard
VI.)</p>

<p>If the clothing of the dead “has not been defiled with seed or
sweat or dirt or vomit, then the worshippers of Mazda shall wash it
with gomez.”—(Fargard VII. Gomez (bull-urine) again alluded to
as the great purifier on pp. 78-80, 104, 117, 118, 122, 123, 128, 182,
183, 212.)</p>

<p>The sacred vessels that had been defiled by the touch of a corpse
were to be cleaned with gomez.—(Idem, pp. 91, 92.)</p>

<p>The most efficacious gomez was that of “an ungelded bull.”—(Idem,
p. 212.)</p>

<p>“They shall cover the surface of the grave with ashes or cow-dung.”—(Fargard
VIII.)</p>

<p>“Let the worshippers of Mazda here bring the urine wherewith the
corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and their bodies.”—(Fargard
VIII. See, also, p. 201 of this volume.)</p>

<p>In describing the funerals of the Eskimo, Gilder says: “The closing
ceremony was a most touching one. After ‘Papa’ had returned from
the grave, Armow went out of doors and brought in a piece of frozen
something that it is not polite to specify, further than that the dogs
had entirely done with it, and with it he touched every block of snow
on a level with the beds of the igloo. The article was then taken out
of doors and tossed up in the air, to fall at his feet; and by the
manner in which it fell he could joyfully announce that there was
no liability of further deaths in camp for some time to come.”—(“Schwatka’s
Search,” Gilder, p. 234.)</p>

<p>“The Africans have an evil spirit called ‘Abiku,’ who takes up his
abode in the human body.” This spirit is believed to cause the death
of children. “If the child dies, the body is thrown on the dirt-heap.”—(“Fetichism,”
Baudin, p. 57.)</p>

<p>There is also a purification of the soul of the dying by the same
peculiar methods. In Coromandel,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the dying man is so placed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
his face will come under the tail of a cow; the tail is lifted, and the
cow excited to void her urine. If the urine fall on the face of the sick
man, the people cry out with joy, considering him to be one of the
blessed; but if the sacred animal be in no humor to gratify their
wishes, they are greatly afflicted.</p>

<p>“The inhabitants of the coast of Coromandel carried those of their
sick who were on the point of death, as a last resource, to the back of
a fat cow, whose tail they twisted to make her urinate; if the cow’s
urine spread over the whole face of the patient, it was a very good
sign to the dirty rascals.”—(Paullini, pp. 80, 81.)</p>

<p>With equal solicitude does the Hottentot medicine-man follow the
remains of his kinsmen to the grave, aspersing with the same sacred
liquid the corpse of the dead and the persons of the mourners who
bewail his fate.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>At Hottentot funerals, “two old men, the friends or relations of the
deceased, enter each circle and sparingly dispense their streams upon
each person, so that all may have some; all the company receive their
water with eagerness and veneration. This being done, each steps
into the hut, and taking up a handful of ashes from the hearth, comes
out by the passage made by the corpse, and strews the ashes by little
and little upon the whole company. This, they say, is done to humble
their pride.”—(Kolbein, p. 401.)</p>

<p>“It is a pity that men in a savage state should take delight in
doing that which is nasty, but such is the fact. It is a very common
custom for the tribe, or that portion of it who are related to the one
who has died, to rub themselves with the moisture that comes from
the dead friend. They rub themselves with it until the whole of
them have the same smell as the corpse.”—(“Aborigines of Victoria,”
Smyth, vol. i. p. 131.) But in a footnote he adds that some of the
Australians will not touch a dead body with the naked hand.</p>

<p>In the mortuary ceremonies of the Encounter Bay tribe (South
Australians), “the old women put human excrement on their heads,—the
sign of deepest mourning.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 113.)</p>

<p>The corpse of an Australian chief was surrounded “with wailing
women, smeared with filth and ashes.”—(“Native Tribes of South
Australia,” Adelaide, 1879, p. 75, received through the kindness of
the Royal Society, New South Wales, Sydney, T. B. Kyngdon,
Secretary.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>“In the burial ceremonies, the women of many tribes besmear or
plaster their heads with excrement and pipe-clay.”—(Personal letter
from John F. Mann, Esq., dated Neutral Bay, Sydney, New South
Wales.)</p>

<p>“When a child dies, women who carried it in their hands must
throw their jackets away if the child has urinated on them. This is
part of the custom that everything that has come in contact with a
dead person must be destroyed.”—(“The Central Eskimo,” Boas,
p. 612.)</p>

<p>The Kootenays of Canada have a ceremonial aspersion after funerals.
“When those who have buried the body return, they take a
thorn bush, dip it into a kettle of water, and sprinkle the doors of all
lodges.”—(“Report on the Northwest Tribes of Canada,” Dr. Franz
Boas, to the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne meeting, 1889, p. 46.)</p>

<p>Describing Italian funerals, Blunt says: “When the procession has
reached the church, the bier is set down in the nave, and the officiating
priest, in the course of the appointed service, sprinkles the body with
holy water three times,—a rite in all probability ensuing from that
practised by the Romans, of thrice sprinkling the bystanders with the
same element.”—(“Vestiges,” p. 183.)</p>

<p>In the Tonga Islands, there are two principal personages,—Tooitonga
and Veachi,—who are believed to be the living representatives
of powerful gods. Upon the death of Tooitonga, certain ceremonies
are practised, among which: “The men now approach the mount,
i. e., the funeral mound, it being dark, and, if the phrase be allowable,
perform the devotions to Cloacina, after which they retire. As soon
as it is daylight the following morning, the women of the first rank,
wives and daughters of the greatest chiefs, assemble with their female
attendants, bringing baskets, one holding one side and one the other,
advancing two and two, with large shells to clear up the depositions of
the preceding night, and in this ceremonious act of humiliation, no
female of the highest consequence refuses to take her part. Some of
the mourners in the ‘fytoca’ generally come out to assist; so that, in
a very little while, the place is made perfectly clean. This is repeated
the fourteen following nights, and as punctually cleaned away by
sunrise every morning. No persons but the agents are allowed to be
witnesses of these extraordinary ceremonies; at least, it would be
considered highly indecorous and irreligious to be so. On the sixteenth
day, early in the morning, the same females again assemble; but now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
they are dressed up in the finest ‘gnatoo,’ and most beautiful Hamao
mats, decorated with ribbons, and with wreaths of flowers round their
necks; they also bring new baskets ornamented with flowers, and little
brooms, very tastefully made. Thus equipped they approach, and act
as if they had the same task to do as before, pretending to clear away
the dirt, though no dirt is now there, and take it away in their blankets....
The natives themselves used to regret that the filthy part
of these ceremonies was necessary to be performed, ... and that it
was the duty of the most exalted nobles, even of the most delicate
females of rank, to perform the meanest and most disgusting offices,
rather than that the sacred grounds in which he was buried should
remain polluted.” (Dillon’s “Expedition in Search of La Perouse,”
London, 1829, vol. ii. pp. 57-59.) Dillon says that this “must be
considered a religious rite, standing upon the foundation of very
ancient customs.”—(Idem, p. 57.)</p>

<span class="smaller">MYTHS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“All peoples have invented myths to explain why they observed
certain customs.”—(“The Golden Bough,” vol. ii. p. 128.)</p>

<p>“Myth changes while custom remains constant; men continue to do
what their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their
fathers acted have long been forgotten. The history of religion is a
long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason; to find a
sound theory for an absurd practice.”—(Idem, p. 62.)</p>

<p>The Australians have a myth of the Creation of Man; it is given in
Latin: “Ningorope lætitiæ plena in latrina lutum amœne erubescens
cernebat; hoc in hominis figuram formabat, quæ tactu divæ motum
vitalem sumebat et donc ridebat.”—(“Aborig. of Victoria,” Smyth,
vol. i. p. 425.)</p>

<p>This myth is given in English from another authority, on next page
of this volume.</p>

<p>The Creation Myth of the Australians relates that the god “Bund-jil
oceanum creavit minctione per plures dies in terrarum orbem.
Bullarto Bulgo magnam lotii copiam indicat.” (Idem, vol. i. p. 429.)
(Bund-jil created the ocean by urinating for many days upon the orb
of the earth.) The natives say that the god being angry “Bullarto
Bulgo” upon the earth. Bullarto Bulgo indicates a great flow of urine.</p>

<p>The same myth has already been given from Andrew Lang, under
“Ordeals and Punishments.”</p>

<p>In the cosmogonical myths of the islanders of Kadiack, it is related
that the first woman, “by making water, produced seas.”—(Lisiansky,
“Voy. round the World,” London, 1814, p. 197.)</p>

<p>“In the fourth story” (i. e., stories told by the Kalmucks and Mongols)
“it is under the excrement of a cow that the enchanted gem,
lost by the daughter of the king, is found.”—(“Zoöl. Mythol.,” De
Gubernatis, p. 129.)</p>

<p>In the mythic lore of the Hindus, the god Utanka sets out on a journey,
protected by Indra. “On his way, he meets a gigantic bull, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
a horseman who bids him, if he would succeed, eat the excrement of
the bull; he does so, rinsing his mouth afterwards.”—(Idem, p. 80.)</p>

<p>Further on we learn that Utanka was told “the excrement of the
bull was the ambrosia which made him immortal in the kingdom of
the serpents.” (Idem, pp. 81, 95.) Here we have the analogue of
the use of excrement and urine in Europe to baffle witches, and of the
drinking of the Siberian girl’s urine, which in all probability was proffered
to the guest as an assurance that no witchcraft was in contemplation,
or else to baffle the witches, much as, in England, bridal
couples urinated through the wedding ring.</p>

<p>The Chinese have a mythical animal which has been identified with
the Tapir; it is called the Mih; to it they ascribe the power to eat
iron and copper. “For this reason the urine of this animal is prescribed
when a person has swallowed iron or copper; it will, in a short
time, change them into water.”—(“Chinese Repository,” Canton,
1839, vol. vii. pp. 46, 47.)</p>

<p>“The story of Joa lo Praube is repeated almost word for word in the
adventures of the Kamtchatkan god ‘Kutka;’ or, to be more exact,
there is a myth in which it is narrated that that god had a great many
tricks played upon him, in one of which he runs sticks into his gluteal
region.”—(Steller, translated by Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>This god Kutka was a great sodomite, and in some points, resembled
the anti-natural god of the Sioux.</p>

<p>Speaking of the god “Aidowedo,” the serpent in the Rainbow as
believed by the Negroes of Guinea, Father Baudin says: “He who
finds the excrement of this serpent is rich forever, for with this talisman
he can change grains of corn into shells which pass for money.”
(“Fetichism,” Rev. F. Baudin, New York, 1885, p. 47.) He goes
on to narrate a very amusing tale to the effect that the negroes got the
idea that a prism in his possession gave him the power to bring the
Rainbow down into his room at will, and that he could obtain unlimited
quantities of the precious excrement.</p>

<p>Another myth of the foolish god “Kutka” represents him as falling
in love with his own excrement and wooing it as his bride; he takes it
home in his sleigh, puts it in his bed, and is only restored to a sense
of his absurd position by the vile smell.—(Steller, translated by
Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>Possibly all this may be a myth to explain or to represent the state
of mind into which those who indulged in the “muck-a-moor” were
thrown, but even this interpretation seems far-fetched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>Sir John Moore, it is stated, fell in love with his own urine, and we
have read from Montaigne the story of the French gentleman who preserved
his egestæ to show to his visitors.</p>

<p>The tribes of the Narinyeri, Encounter Bay, South Australia, have
a legend that difference in language was caused when certain of their
ancestors “ate the contents of the intestines of the goddess ‘Wurruri.’”—(“Nat.
tribes of South Australia,” Adelaide, 1879, p. 60, received
through the kindness of the Roy. Soc., Sydney, N. S. Wales, T. B.
Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>In the same chapter we are told of the omission of one or two ceremonies
“which were too indecent for general readers” (p. 61).</p>

<p>In the “Bachiller de Salamanca,” Le Sage has a hero whose misfortunes
would lead us to suspect that Le Sage had been reading of some
of the doings of the Kamtchatkan god “Kutka,” who, among the numerous
pranks played upon him by his enemies, the mice, suffered the
ignominy of having “a bag made of fish-skin attached to his orificium ani
while he lay sound asleep. On his way home Kutka desired to relieve
nature, but was much surprised, on leaving, at the insignificant deposit
notwithstanding he had freed himself of so great a burden.</p>

<p>“Surprised at his cleanliness, he narrated the circumstances to Clachy
(his wife), who soon discovered the true state of affairs, and pulling off
Kutka’s pantaloons, detached the heavily laden bag with great laughters.”—(Steller,
translated by Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>In the 14th century farce of “Le Muynier,” the Miller has absorbed
some of the popular ideas of his day, professed by certain philosophers
of the time. He believes that, at the moment of death, the
soul of a man escapes by the anus, and warns the priest to absolve him
from his sins, saying: “Mon ventre trop se détermine. Helas! Je
ne scay que je face; ostez-vous.”</p>

<p>The priest answers: “Ha! sauf vostre grace!”</p>

<p>Then the miller remarks: “Ostez-vous, car je me conchye.”</p>

<p>The wife and the priest pull the sick man to the edge of the bed and
place him in such a position that if the doctrine of soul-departure by
the anus be true, they may witness the miller’s final performance.
The phenomenon of rectal flatulence is now observed, when suddenly, to
the consternation of the wife and priest, a demon appears and placing
a sack over the dying miller’s anus, catches the rectal gas and flies off
in sulphurous vapor.—(“Med. in the Middle Ages,” Minor, p. 84,
translated from “Le Moyen Age Médical,” by Dupouy.)</p>

<p>It was generally believed in Europe that the eggs of the Basilisk or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
Cockatrice could only be hatched by a toad or by the heat of a manure-pile.—(See
“Mélusine,” Paris, January-February, 1890, p. 20.)</p>

<p>Ireland has been called the “Urinal of the Planets” from the constant
and copious rains which visit it.—(See Grose, “Dict. of Buckish
Slang,” London, 1811.)</p>

<p>The Apaches have a myth, or story, the analogue of the “Fee-fo-Fum”
of our own childhood; but the giant, instead of smelling the
blood of an Englishman, in the words given in Spanish, “huele la
cagada.”</p>

<p>The Chinese myth concerning the wonderful digestive powers of the
“Mih” has its counterpart in the ancient belief that the same power
was possessed by the Ostrich.</p>

<p>“The Wangwana and Wanyumbo informed me ... that if the elephant
observes the excrement of the rhinoceros unscattered, he waxes
furious, and proceeds instantly in search of the criminal, when woe
befall him if he is sulky, and disposed to battle for the proud privilege
of leaving his droppings as they fall. The elephant, in that case,
breaks off a heavy branch of a tree, or uproots a stout sapling like a
boat’s mast, and belabors the unfortunate beast until he is glad to save
himself by hurried flight. For this reason, the natives say, the rhinoceros
always turns round and thoroughly scatters what he has
dropped.”—(“Through the Dark Continent,” Henry M. Stanley, New
York, 1878, vol. i. p. 477.)</p>

<p>“In other myths, in the Brahmanas, Prajapati creates man from his
body, or rather the fluid of his body becomes a tortoise, the tortoise
becomes a man, etc.”—(“Myth, Ritual, and Religion,” Andrew Lang,
London, 1887, vol. ii. p. 248. See also under chapter on the Mistletoe,
p. 99 of this volume.)</p>

<p>“Moffatt is astonished at the South African notion that the sea was
accidentally created by a girl.” (“Myth, Ritual, and Religion,”
Lang, vol. i. p. 91.) Perhaps this tale belongs to our series of myths.</p>

<p>“The Encounter Bay people have another myth, which might have
been attributed by Dean Swift to the Yahoos, so foul an origin does it
attribute to mankind.”—(Idem, Lang, vol. i. p. 170.)</p>

<p>“As the mythology and traditions of other heathen nations are more
or less immoral and obscene, so it is with these people.” (“Nat.
Trib. of S. Australia,” p. 200.) “Mingarope having retired upon a
natural occasion was highly pleased with the red color of her excrement,
which she began to mould into the form of a man, and tickling
it, it showed signs of life and began to laugh.”—(Idem, p. 201.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>The myth relating that differences in language sprung up after certain
of the tribes had eaten the excrement of the goddess “Wurruri”
is given on p. 268; it has been recited in this volume on a previous
page. There was another god, named Nurunduri, of whom the story
is told that he once made water in a certain spot, “from which circumstance
the place is called Kainjamin (to make water.)”—(Idem, p.
205.)</p>

<p>Among the Bilgula of British Columbia, there is a myth which relates
that a certain stump of a tree was a cannibal and had captured a
girl. Once, when he had gone out to fish for halibut, “he ordered his
urinary vessel to call him if the girl should make an attempt to escape.
When she did so, the vessel cried, ‘Rota-gota, Rota-gota, gota.’”—(Personal
letter from Dr. Franz Boas, Clark University, Worcester,
Mass.)</p>

<p>There is a riddle among the Kamtchatkans in regard to human feces:
“My father has numerous forms and dresses; my mother is warm and
thin and bears every day. Before I am born, I like cold and warmth,
but after I am born, only cold. In the cold I am strong, and in the
warmth, weak; if cold, I am seen far; if warm, I am smelled far.”—(Steller,
translated by Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>Among some of the Eskimo tribes the Raven is represented as talking
to its own excrement and consulting it; excrement occurs frequently
in their legends.—(Personal letter from Dr. Boas, as above.)</p>

<p>From the preceding paragraph we see that the Eskimo must have
formerly, even if they do not now, consulted excrement in their Divination;
the extract from Gilder, given under “Mortuary Ceremonies”
confirms this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The people of Kamtchatka believed that rain was the urine of
Billutschi, one of their gods, and of his genii; but, after this god has
urinated enough, he puts on a new dress made in the form of a sack,
and provided with fringes of red seal hair, and variously colored strips
of leather. These represent the origin of the Rainbow.</p>

<p>The Kamtchatkan god Kutka was once pursued by enemies, but
saved himself “by ejecting from his bowels all kinds of berries, which
detained his pursuers.”</p>

<p>The myths of the Kamtchatkans offer a parallel to the stories that
the presents of the devil always turned into dross. There is the story
of the god Kutka, upon whom, as we have seen, many tricks were
played. In one the food with which he supplied himself “turned into
peat, rotten wood, and piss.”—(Steller, translated by Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“The Central Eskimo believe that rain is the urine of a deity.”—(See
“The Central Eskimo,” Boas, p. 600.)</p>

<p>“Amber (as some thinke) is made of whale’s dung.”—(John Leo,
“Observ. of Africa,” in Purchas, vol. ii. p. 772.)</p>

<p>Ambergris was anciently supposed to be the dung of the whale or
other monster of the sea.—(Mr. W. W. Rockhill.)</p>

<p>This view about the origin of amber was not credited by Avicenna.
“Ambram non esse stercus animalis maris.”—(Vol. i. p. 273, b10.)</p>

<p>In the liturgy of the hill tribes of the Nilgherris, it is related—</p>

<p>Réclus, in the same work, gives a fragment of an Orphic song:
“Glorieux Jupiter, le plus grand des Olympiens, toi qui te plais dans

<p>“The blessed Apostle Paul, being rapt in contemplation of divine
blissfulness, compares all the chief felicities of the earth, esteeming
them (to use his own words) as ‘stercora,’ most filthy dung in regard
of the joys he hoped for.”—(Harington, “Ajax,” p. 26.)</p>

<p>“He is truly wise that accounteth all earthly things as dung that
he may win Christ.”—(Matt. xvii. 23, quoted in Thomas à Kempis,

<p>“It was current among the small boys at school some thirty-five
years since, that were a man to make water whilst in connection with
a woman she would die.”—(Personal letter from Prof. Frank Rede
Fowke, South Kensington Museum, London, England.)</p>

<p>The name of the city of Chicago has been traced by some philologist
to the Indian word for skunk; and it is said to be “equal to bestiola
fœda mingens.” The urine of this little animal was believed by some
of the Indian tribes to be capable of blinding the man in whose eyes
it entered; the animal itself was deified by the Aztecs under the name
of Tezcatlipoca.</p>

Kelton, U. S. Army, Chicago, Illinois, 1888.</p>

<span class="smaller">URINOSCOPY, OR DIAGNOSIS BY URINE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The examination of the urine and feces of the sick seems to have
obtained in all parts of the world, and among all sorts of people;
but in the earlier stages of human progress it was complicated with
ideas of divination and forecast, which would make it a religious
observance.</p>

<p>The health of a patient was shown by the condition of his urine.—(Pliny,
lib. xxviii. cap. 6.)</p>

<p>The Arabians used to bring to their doctors “the water of their sick
in phials.”—(Burton, “Arabian Nights,” vol. iv. p. 11.)</p>

<p>In the index to the Works of Avicenna there are two hundred and
seventy-five references to the appearance, etc., of the urine of the sick.—(Translation
of Avicenna made by Gerard of Cremona, edition of
Venice, 1595.)</p>

<p>“Apothecaries used to carry the water of their patients to the
physician.”—(Fosbroke, “Encyclopædia of Antiquities,” vol. i. p. 526,
article “Urine.”)</p>

<p>To determine whether a man had an affection of the lungs or liver,
some of his urine was cast upon wheat bran, which was then put aside
in a cool place; if worms appeared, he was afflicted, etc.—(Beckherius,
“Med. Microcosmus,” p. 62.)</p>

<p>From an examination of the feces and urine of the patient to determine
his present state of health, and if possible to make a prognosis of
his future condition, was, in the minds of ignorant or half-educated
men merely the first step in the direction of determining the future of
the commonwealth by an inspection of the viscera and the excrement of
the victims whose blood smoked upon its altars. The Romans were
addicted to this mode of divination, which Schurig incorrectly styles
“Anthropomancy.” He relates that Heliogabalus was especially fond
of this, and, indeed, he credits that voluptuary with its introduction,
and expresses his gratification that he met his deserts in being killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
in a privy and left to die in ordure. The Saxons also were given to
this method of consulting the future.—(See “Chylologia,” pp. 749,
750.)</p>

<p>“Uromantie. ff. (Med. et Divin.), mot formé de “ouron,” urine, et
“manteia,” divination, qui signifie l’art de diviner par le moyen des
urines l’état présent d’une maladie, et d’en prédire les évènements
futurs.”—(“Encyc. ou Dict. Rais. des Sciences,” etc., fol. Neufchatel,
1745, vol. xvii. p. 499, given in personal letter to Captain Bourke from
Professor Frank Rede Fowke, South Kensington Museum, London,
England.)</p>

<p>“<i>Falstaff.</i> Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</p>

<p>“<i>Page.</i> He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water; but for the
party that owed it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.”—(Shakspeare,
“2 King Henry IV.,” i. 2.)</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Thomas More was possessed of great wit and a fine flow of
spirits, which even the approach of death could not dispel. Upon
receiving notification that he had been condemned to death by his
master, King Henry VIII., “he called for his urinal, and having made
water in it, he cast it and viewed it (as physicians do) a pretty while;
at last he sware soberly that he saw nothing in that man’s water but
that he might live if it pleased the king.”—(“Ajax,” p. 61.)</p>

<p>Thibetan doctors examine the urine of the patient; then churn
it and listen to the noise made by the bubbles.—(Mr. W. W.
Rockhill.)</p>

<p>The people of Europe did not restrict their examinations to the
egestæ of human beings; they were equally careful to scrutinize every
day the droppings of the hounds, hawks, and other animals used in
the chase.—(See “Ajax.”)</p>

<p>In the farce of “Master Pathelin” (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1480), the hero, “in his
ravings abuses the doctors ... for not understanding his urine....
Charlatans especially exploited in this field of medicine, practising it
illegally in the country under the name of ‘water-jugglers’ and ‘water-judges.’
Such men still practise in Normandy and in certain northern
provinces of France.”—(“Med. in the Middle Ages,” Minor, p. 82.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“It is a common practice in these days, by a colourable deriuation
of supposed cunning from the vrine, to foretell casualties, and the
ordinary euents of life, conceptions of a woman with child, and
definite distinctions of the male and female in the womb.” (Cotta,
“Short Discovery,” London, 1612, p. 104. He goes on to say that
even as a mode of strict medical diagnosis, urinoscopy is not a certain
test, the body, in every disease, being more or less disordered, and this
disorder acting upon the urine.)</p>

<p>Montaigne tells the story of a gentleman who always kept for seven
or eight days his excrements, in different basins, in order to talk about
and show them. (Buckle, “Commonplace Book,” vol. ii. p. 357,
quoting from Montaigne’s “Essais,” lib. iii. cap. 9, p. 600.)</p>

<p>Speaking of melancholy people, Burton says, “Their urine is most
part pale and low-colored, ‘urina pauca, acris, biliosa’ (Arctæus), and
not much in quantity.... Their melancholy excrements, in some very
much, in others little.”—(“Anatomy of Melancholy,” vol. i. p. 268.)</p>

<h3>ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE EMOTIONS UPON THE EGESTÆ.</h3>

<p>Reciprocally, the influence exerted by the emotions over functional
disturbances has been made the subject of investigation by learned
commentators.</p>

<p>“Aristote, dans les Problèmes Physiques, s’occupe des rapports qui
lient les impressions de l’âme aux fonctions intestinales. Il recherche
pourquoi une frayeur subite et violente cause presque toujours et incontinent
la diarrhée.” (Aule-Gelée, lib. xix. c. 4, “Bib. Scatalog.”
p. 66.)</p>

<p>Schurig gives numbers of instances of the power of the mind over
the act of alvine dejection; evacuation may be caused by perturbation
of mind, by fear, by insomnia, by thunder, by anger, etc. See “Chylologia,”
p. 701. In a preceding chapter Schurig narrates several
examples of people, principally women, who were never able to excite
nature to the act of evacuation except by artificial aids addressed to
some faculty of the mind,—imagination, laughing, etc.</p>

<p>Harington, in “Ajax,” mentions the case of the Pope’s Legate,
“who brought the last jubilee into France; who, fearing the pages
who by custom bustle about him to divide his canopie, and suspecting
treason among them, suddenly laid you wot of in his breeches” (p. 16).</p>

<p>Dr. Fletcher, United States Army, has devoted considerable attention
to this subject. He has kindly placed the results of his wide
range of reading at the disposal of the author of this volume.</p>

<p>“The more you cry, the less you piss,”—a vulgar saying of considerable
antiquity. This saying is founded upon a correct physiological
observation; an excess of one secretion results in a proportionate
diminution of others.</p>

into Hellenic characters the above homely saw, and thereby mystified
the learned pundits who were called upon to read it.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">ORDURE AND URINE IN MEDICINE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The administration of urine as a curative opens the door to a flood
of thought. Medicine, both in theory and practice, even among
nations of the highest development and refinement, has not, until
within the present century, cleared its skirts of the superstitious hand-prints
of the dark ages. With tribes of a lower degree of culture it
is still subordinate to the incantations and exorcisms of the “medicine
man.” It might not be going a step too far to assert that the science
of therapeutics, pure and simple, has not yet taken form among savages;
but to shorten discussion and avoid controversy, it will be assumed
here that such a science does exist, but in an extremely rude
and embryotic state; and to this can be referred all examples of the
introduction of urine or ordure in the <i>materia medica</i>, where the aid
of the “medicine man” does not seem to have been invoked, as in
the method employed for the eradication of dandruff by Mexicans,
Eskimo, and others, the Celtiberian dentifrice, etc.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>When the compilation and correlation of data bearing upon this subject
was first begun, the exceeding importance of the pharmaceutical
division was manifest. In the opinion of the author, this part of the
investigation should have been assumed by a student possessed of a preliminary
training in medicine, and it was not until urged on by friendly
correspondents that he concluded, upon resuming his labors, to augment
these references by citations from the more prominent writers
of ancient and modern times, who have demonstrated the importance
of the subject by devoting to its consideration not passing sentences
and scant allusions, but pregnant chapters and bulky volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>By great good fortune he was enabled to make the fullest use of
the library of the Army Medical Museum, which, under the supervision
of Surgeon John S. Billings, United States Army, has become
the finest special bibliothèque in the world.</p>

<p>From Surgeon Billings, and his able assistants, Doctors Fletcher
and Wise, were received, besides the courteous attentions which every
student has the right to expect, an intelligent and sympathetic co-operation
which cannot be too gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>In such an embarrassment of riches as now confronted him, he
exercised the right of drawing only upon the authorities which would
appeal to all critics as most entitled to prominence; to have followed
any other course, and to have attempted to engraft all available material,
would have swollen this chapter to hundreds, perhaps thousands
of pages.</p>

<p>“Sprengel pense que Asclépiade, surnommé Pharmacion, est le premier
qui ait conseillé les excréments humains; mais il est probable
qu’il ne fit qu’ériger en préceptes écrits un usage déjà consacré en
Orient, particulièrement en Egypte.”—(“Bib. Scat.,” pp. 29, 30.)</p>

<p>The earliest writer whose works have been consulted was Hippocrates,
termed the “Father of Medicine,” born 460 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> “He was a
member of the family of the Asclepiadæ, ... and a descendant of both
Esculapius and Hercules. He was born of a family of priest-physicians,
and was the first to throw superstition aside, and to base the practice
of medicine on the principles of inductive philosophy.”—(“Encyclopædia
Britannica.”)</p>

<p>Galen wrote a series of commentaries upon his writings. Medical
commentators are not in accord as to how many of the works attributed
to him are genuine; but the editions of the accepted and the
suspected to be spurious are almost innumerable, and printed in every
language of Europe.</p>

<p>In the edition by Francis Adams (Sydenham Society, London, 1849),
there is no mention of the use of human or animal excreta in pharmacy.
But in another edition can be read that ass’s dung was given to restrain
excessive catamenial flow.—(Kuhn’s edition, Leipsig, 1829,
vol. i. p. 481.)</p>

<p>Etmuller says that Hippocrates prescribed hawk-dung to aid in the
expulsion of the fœtus and as a remedy for sterility (vol. ii. p. 285).
The general use of excrementitious material in the medical practice of
Hippocrates’ own day must be accepted from evidence deduced from
outside sources. For example, Aristophanes, who was his contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
(born 446 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Encyc. Britan.), stigmatized all the medical fraternity
as “excrement-eaters;” and Xenocrates, another practitioner of the
same date, of whose writings, however, nothing has come down to us
beyond the meagre outline to be found in the commentaries of Galen,
made constant employment not only of human and animal excreta, but
of all the secretions and excretions as well. According to Appleton’s
Encyclopædia, Xenocrates was born 396 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Schurig relates of Aristophanes that he called doctors “fecivores
... quod quidem adulatores fuerint quin excrementa Magnorum degustare
voluerint.” He also says: “Quare de illo non inepte dixit
quidam, eum dignum fuisse Xenocrates Medico, qui excrementis variis
animalium omnes morbos curare solitus erat.”—(“Chylologia,”
p. 82.)</p>

<p>“Xenocrates, who flourished sixty years before Galen, had also a
good list of nasty prescriptions, for which the veil of a dead language
is required.” (“Saxon Leechdoms,” lib. i. p. xviii.) These included
the urine of women and their catamenia.</p>

<p>Aristophanes called the physicians of his time σκατοφάγους, or excrement-eaters.
“Ce qui était plus malin que vrai, car les compères en
faisaient manger à leurs clients plus qu’ils n’en mangeaient eux-mêmes.”—(“Bibliotheca
Scatalogica.”)</p>

<p>Human excrements, under the name of “botryon,” were used by
Æschines of Athens, for the cure of quinsy. (Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 10.)
Æschines lived between 389-317 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>“Serapion of Alexandria flourished <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 278, forty years after the
date of Alexander the Great, and was one of the chiefs of the empiric
school.... He in epilepsy prescribed ... dung of crocodiles.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. xiv.)</p>

<p>The next in chronological order would be Pliny, from whom can be
extracted a veritable mine of information on this point; then Dioscorides,
who lived in the latter years of the first and the opening ones of
the second centuries of the Christian era; and then Galen, born at
Pergamos, in Mysia, 130 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, “the most celebrated of ancient medical
writers,” and “appointed by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius to the
position of medical guardian of his son, the young prince, and later on
Emperor, Commodus.”—(Encyc. Brit.)</p>

<p>The classical authorities will conclude with Sextus Placitus, from
whose works much of importance has been extracted.</p>

<p>Each author will be allowed to speak in his own words, and the
necessary deductions will be made afterwards; only the remarks bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
upon love-philters and child-birth have been assigned to the chapters
devoted to the treatment of those subjects, and this merely to
reduce the chances of repetition.</p>

<p>The following remedies are taken from Pliny, from the books and
chapters given opposite each case:—</p>

<p>“A plant that has been grown upon a dung-heap in a field is a very
efficacious remedy, taken in water, for quinsy.”—(Lib. xxiv. c. 110.)</p>

<p>“A plant upon which a dog has watered, torn up by the roots, and
not touched with iron, is a very speedy cure for sprains.”—(Idem,
c. 111.)</p>

<p>“Camel’s dung, reduced into ashes, and incorporat with oile, doth
curle and frizzle the hair of the head, and taken in drinke, as much as
a man may comprehend with three fingers, cureth the dysenterie; so
doth it also the falling sickness. Camel’s piss, they say, is passing
good for Fullers to scour their cloth withall; and the same healeth
any running sores which be bathed therein. It is well known that the
barbarous nations keep this stale of theirs until it be five years old,
and then a draught thereof to the quantity of one hermine is a good
laxative potion.”—(Lib. xxviii. c. 8.)</p>

<p>Goat’s dung good for sore eyes.—(Idem, c. 11.)</p>

<p>For “Skals in the Head” the Romans used “Bul’s Urine.” Stale
chamber-lye was also considered good. “The gall of buck goats, tempered
with Bul’s stale, killeth lice.” Dog-dung and goat-dung also
were prescribed.—(Idem, c. 11.)</p>

<p>Wolf’s dung is mentioned as good for cataract.—(Idem, c. 11.)</p>

<p>Hen’s dung, the white part, prescribed for the cure of poisonous
mushrooms; also to cure flatulence (but in any living creature it causes
flatulence, says Pliny). Ashes of horse-dung fresh made and burned,
the urine of a wild boar, the green dung of an ass, are among the
medicaments mentioned for ear-ache (idem, c. 11); also “Urine of a
Bul or a Goat, or stale chamber lye made hotte;” also “Calfe’s Pisse,
Calfe’s dung.” Goat and horse dung were employed to drive away
snakes.—(Idem, c. 110.)</p>

<p>Human urine used in curing the bites of mad dogs.—(Idem,
c. 18.)</p>

<p>Pliny notices that the Greeks used the scrapings of the bodies of
athletes for emmenagogues, for uterine troubles, for sprains, muscular
rheumatism, etc. “We find authors of the very highest repute proclaiming
aloud that the seminal fluid is a sovereign remedy for the
sting of the scorpion. In the case, too, of a woman afflicted with sterility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
they recommend the application of a pessary made of the fresh
excrement voided by an infant at the moment of its birth.... They
have even gone so far, too, as to scrape the very filth from off the
walls of the gymnasia, and to assert that this is possessed of certain
calorific properties.... The urine has been the subject not only of
numerous theories with authors, but of various religious observances
as well, its properties being classified under several distinctive heads;
thus, for instance, the urine of eunuchs, they say, is highly beneficial as
a promoter of fruitfulness in females.” He mentions the urine of children
as a sovereign remedy for the poisonous secretion of the asp, which “spits
its venom into the eyes of human beings.” Human urine was used in
eye troubles, “albugo, films, and marks upon the eyes, white specks
upon the pupils, and maladies of the eyelids.” It was also used in the
cure of burns, suppuration of the ears, as an emmenagogue, for sun-burn,
and for taking out ink-spots. “Male urine cured Gout.” Urine cured
“eruptions on the bodies of infants, corrosive sores, running ulcers,
chaps upon the body, stings inflicted by serpents, ulcers of the head,
and cancerous sores of the generative organs.... Every person’s
urine is the best for his own case.”—(Lib. xxviii. c. 18.)</p>

<p>The ashes of camel’s dung were administered internally in epilepsy,
and also for dysentery.—(Idem, c. 27.)</p>

<p>Camel’s urine applied to running sores; barbarous nations kept it
for five years, and then used it as a purgative.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>The dung of the hippopotamus was used in fumigations, “for the
cure of a cold ague.”—(Idem, c. 31.)</p>

<p>The urine of the once (ounce) “helpeth the strangury;” it was also
taken internally for sore throat.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Hyena-urine “is said to be useful in diseases of long standing”
(idem, c. 27); also given in drink for dysentery; also applied in liniments.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Crocodile-dung used for eye troubles and for epilepsy; used in form
of a pessary, as an emmenagogue.—(Lib. xxviii. c. 29.)</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF DIOSCORIDES.</h3>

<p>Dioscorides devotes a chapter to the medicinal values of different
ordures; a condensation only of the translation need be given, since
the original is inserted.</p>

<p>The fresh dung of domestic cattle was considered good for inflamed
wounds; for pains at extremity of spine; and, when made into a plaster
with oil, it dissolved glandular and scrofulous swellings and tumors.
The dung of bulls was a remedy for falling of the womb; when drunk
with wine, was frequently given as a remedy in epilepsy; used also in
the cure of suppressed menstruation and to expel the fœtus in retarded
delivery; administered in menstrual hemorrhages; for the alleviation
of gout in the feet, serpent bites, erysipelas, etc. Goat and sheep
dung was used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>Dried goat-dung, drunk in wine, checked hemorrhages, as did that
of asses and horses. The dung of grass-fed kine taken in wine for
scorpion bites.</p>

<p>Dove and poultry dung given to break up the old sores and scrofulous
swellings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>Hen-dung believed to be almost a specific against the effects of
poisonous mushrooms; it was to be drunk in wine.</p>

<p>Stork-dung was another remedy for epilepsy; it was also to be drunk
in wine.</p>

<p>Vulture-dung expelled the fœtus; mouse-dung expelled calculi.</p>

<p>Hen-dung, especially that laid during the dog-days, was good for
dysentery.</p>

<p>Fresh human ordure was applied to inflamed wounds, and as a plaster
in angina; dog-dung was also used in such cases.</p>

<p>Crocodile-excrement was in high repute as a cosmetic. (See “Cosmetics.”)
Purchasers were warned that it was frequently adulterated
with the excrement of starlings fed on rice.</p>

<p>The urine of the patient himself should be drunk in cases of serpent
bites, poisons from drugs, bites of scorpions, mad dogs, etc. For old
ulcers, cicatrices, “lepras,” an excellent application; also for ulcerations
in the genitalia, sores in the ears, etc.</p>

<p>The urine of an undefiled boy was highly commended for various
purposes, especially when triturated with honey in a brass mortar.</p>

<p>The “sediment of urine” (see “Mangeurs de Blanc”) was regarded
as of great value in erysipelas. Bull’s urine was given for the cure of
ulcerated ears.</p>

<p>Goat urine expelled stone from the bladder; likewise, beneficial in
dropsy, if drunk daily.</p>

<p>Asses’ urine cured mania.</p>

<p>“Dioscoride, lib. ii. cap. 73, et ses commentateurs, P. Andr. Mathicle,
fol. 238, et J. Cornarius, comment. cap. 69, fol. m. 134, permettent
l’usage des stercoraria pour les paysans, et quand on n’a rien de mieux
sous la main, mais ils l’interdisent pour les habitants des villes et les
personnages honorati alicujus estimationis. Outre son grand ouvrage,
de maître médical on attribue généralement à Dioscoride un traité
désigné sous le titre de Euporista, ou des remèdes faciles à procurer.”
(This was published at Strasbourg and again at Frankfort in 1565 and
1598, respectively, from the original Greek.) “Dans l’Euporista,
Dioscoride cherche à établir que les remèdes indigènes valent souvent
mieux que ceux qu’on fait venir à grands frais des pays éloignés, et, à
ce titre, il mentionne le stercus comme offrant de curieuses ressources.”—(“Bib.
Scatalogica,” p. 74.)</p>

pp. 227 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>On p. 228 Dioscorides speaks of the use of a medicine known as
“lynx urine,” but which he says was a variety of amber.</p>

<h3>THE VIEWS OF GALEN.</h3>

<p>Galen disapproved of the pharmaceutical use of human ordure on
account of its abominable smell, but he assented to the employment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
of that of domestic cattle, goats, crocodiles, and dogs; he makes
known, moreover, that human ordure was taken internally, as a medicine,
by very many persons.</p>

<p>“De Copro, Stercore, Copros, sive Copron, sive Apoptema, apellari
velis perinde est. Scito autem hanc substantiam vim habere vel maxime
digerentem. Verum stercus humanum ob fœtorem abominandum
est, at bubulum, caprinum, crocodilorum terrestrium, et canum, ubi in
ossibus duntaxat vescuntur neque graviter olet, et multa experientia
non tantum nobis, sed et aliis medicis me natu majoribus comprobatum
est. Siquidem Asclepiades cui cognomentum erat Pharmaceon, et alia
omnia medicamenta collegit, ut multos impleret libros, et stercore ad
multos sæpe affectus utitur non modo medicamentis, quæ focis imponuntur
commiscens, sed iis quoque quæ intro in os sumuntur.”—(Galeni
Claudii, “Opera Omnia,” edit. of Dr. Carl Gottleib Kuhn,
Leipsig, 1826, vol. xii., pp. 290, 291.)</p>

<p>Dog-dung, especially of an animal “sola ossa cani edenda exhibens
duobus continuo diebus, ex quibus durum, candidum, ac minime fœtorum
stercus proveniebat.” Such dog-dung was administered in angina,
dysentery, inveterate ulcers, etc., in milk or other convenient menstruum.—(Idem,
vol. xii. p. 291.)</p>

<p>The urine of boys was drunk by patients suffering from the plague
in Syria, but the year is not given.—(See idem, vol. xii. p. 285.)</p>

<p>Galen did not believe that calculi had the slightest value for effecting
a reduction of calculi.—(Idem, lib. xii. p. 290.)</p>

<p>Galen could not bring himself to agree with Xenocrates, who recommended
the internal and external employment of sweat, urine, catamenial
fluid, and ear-wax in medicine. (Idem, lib. xii. p. 249.) “At
potis sudoris aut urinæ aut mensium mulieris abominanda detestandaque
est, atque horum in primis stercus, quod tamen scribit Xenocrates,
si oris ac gutturis partibus inungatur et in ventrem devoretur, quid
præstare valeat.—Scripsit etiam de aurium sordis devorandis. At ego
ne has quidem morbo deinceps liber degerem. Atque his etiam magis
abominandum puto stercus. Estque probrum gravius homini modesto
audire stercorivorum quam fellatorum aut cinædum.”</p>

<p>He shows that it was used by some physicians in “psoras,” and in
“lepras,” in the washing of ulcers, affections of the ears and genitalia,
as an embrocation and a liniment for scald and scabby head, and by
rustics in the alleviation of the pains of sore feet. (Galen, lib. xii.
p. 285 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Galen instances the ordure of a boy, dried, mixed with Attic honey,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
given as a cure for consumption. “Stercus pueri siccum cum melle
Attico ad lævorem tritum.” (Idem, lib. xii. p. 294.) The boy was
to be fed on vegetables and well-cooked bread, leavened, made with a
little salt, in a small oven (Clibanus, Dutch oven?). The boy was also
to be temperate in drink, using only a small quantity of good wine.—(Idem,
lib. xii. p. 294.)</p>

<p>Wolf-dung was given in drink, in the intervals between the paroxysms
of colic; the white excrement ejected after eating bones was regarded
as the stronger, and especially that which had not touched the
ground,—a thing not difficult to find, because he says the wolf has
the same disposition as the dog; that is, to eject its urine and ordure
upon rocks, stones, thorns, and bushes, whenever possible, etc.—(Galen,
“Opera Omnia,” Kuhn’s edition, lib. xii. pp. 295-297.)</p>

<p>Goat-dung was useful in the reduction of inveterate hard tumors
and boils. Galen used it with great success when made into a cataplasm
with barley meal. “We also use it,” he adds, “in dropsy”
(“aquam inter cutem”). It was also employed in “lepras,” “psoras,”
and other skin affections. It was applied as a plaster in tumors and
other swellings and in abscesses of the ear; also in bites of vipers
and other wild beasts (“aliarum bestiarum”). It was drunk in wine
as a cure for the yellow jaundice, and applied as a suppository, mixed
with incense, in uterine hemorrhages. But Galen thought that the
internal employment at least of such disgusting curatives is of questionable
expediency, especially when more agreeable remedies may
be available. This objection would, of course, apply with special force
in cities, although he admits that travellers, country people, and those
suffering from poison, must use the first thing within reach (vol. xii.
p. 299). Bull-dung was regarded by Galen as of value in the cure of
the stings of bees and wasps (see notes on the same subject taken in
the State of New Jersey). In Mysia, a country near the Hellespont,
physicians ordered it to be smeared on the skins of dropsical patients
in the sun. The same treatment was supposed to help consumptive
patients, if the dung was that of grass-fed stock; but he repeats that
such remedies are better adapted for rustics than for the inhabitants
of cities (lib. xii. p. 301).</p>

<p>Sheep-dung was used for all kinds of warty and excrescential growths
externally, either raw or burnt, and in the latter case was often mixed
with, or superseded by, goat-dung (lib. xii. p. 302).</p>

<p>The dung of wild doves was preferred to the excrement of the domestic
pigeon; administered internally, generally mixed with the seed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
of the nasturtium, in all inveterate pains affecting sides, shoulders,
skull, loins, kidneys, in vertigo, head-aches, etc. It was used just as
frequently in cities as in rural communities (lib. xii. p. 302).</p>

<p>Mouse-dung seems to have been extensively used in medical practice,
although Galen ridicules the fact, and does not mention the purposes
of its employment (lib. xii. p. 307).</p>

<p>The dung of barn-yard fowl was used for the same purposes as dove-dung.
Some people thought that the dung was more efficacious if
dropped by a fowl that had been stuffed with mushrooms. Galen here
takes occasion to remark that all animals must differ in the character
of their excreta as they do in their food; the same animal, by a change
of habitat, and consequent change of food, must cause a perceptible
variation in the qualities of its excrement (lib. xii. p. 304). Galen
flatly expresses his disbelief in the medicinal value of the excrement of
the goose, stork, eagle, or hawk, although he admits that they were
used internally by many practitioners of good standing, in difficulties
of the respiratory organs; but he says these same authorities are wont
to extol the merits, in the treatment of the same diseases, of such absurd
remedies as night-owl’s blood, human urine, etc.—(Galen, lib. 12,
p. 305.)</p>

<p>Lucian, in his treatise upon remedies for the cure of gout (“tragopodagra”),
makes mention in several places of excrementitious remedies,—as,
for example, “dung of mountain-goat and man,”</p>

<h3>SEXTUS PLACITUS.</h3>

<p>This author is supposed to have lived in the beginning of the fourth
century after Christ.</p>

<p>The edition of his work, “De Medicamentis ex Animalibus,” was
printed in Lyons, in 1537. The pages are not numbered, and the
citations are consequently by chapter.</p>

<p>Goat-urine was given as a drink to dropsical patients (“De Capro”).
This urine was also drunk by women to relieve suppression of the
menses.</p>

<p>For inflammation of the joints, goat-dung was dried and applied as a
fine powder; for colic, a fomentation of hot goat-dung was applied to
the abdomen; for serpent bites it was applied as a plaster, and also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
drunk in some convenient liquor. For tumors goat-dung was to be
applied externally.</p>

<p>For ear troubles goat-urine was applied as a lotion. “Ad aures
nimus bene audientium, Apri lotium in nitro repositum tepefactum,
auribus instillatur audire facit” (“De Apro”).</p>

<p>For burns, whether by water or fire, burnt cow-dung was to be
sprinkled on. “Ad combusturam sive ab aqua, sive ab igne factam,
Taurinus fimus combustus et aspersus sanat” (“De Tauro”).</p>

<p>“Ad profluvium mulierum, Taurus ibicuncque pastus fuerit folia
ulmi arboris de fimo ipsius facias siccari et terre in pollinem tenuissimum,
mitte ipsum in carbones in quodam testo, et deponas in vaso et
sedeat mulier quæ patitur encatesma diligenter co-operta (well covered
up), et sanabitur ut mireris” (“De Tauro”).</p>

<p><i>Testo</i> means the “lid of a pot;” <i>encatesma</i> means a “sitting-bath;”
and the sense seems to be that the woman was to take the dung of a
bull which had been eating the leaves of an elm-tree, dry, reduce to
fine powder, throw on hot coals on the lid of a pot, and let the woman
sit on this, well covered up, and have a steam-bath.</p>

<p>For all kinds of tumors, as well as for every kind of head-ache,
the dung of elephants was applied externally. (“De Elephantis.”)
He makes no mention of the use of asses’ dung, but strongly recommends
the use of the excrement of the horse. “Ad sanguinem e
naribus profluentem, equi stercus siccum et aspersum, sanguinem
fluentem retinet, maxime naribus suffumigatum.” He also recommends
the use of horse-dung externally in the treatment of ear-ache,
and for retention of the menses internally. “Ad aurium dolorem,
stercus equi siccum et rosaceo succo liquefactum et collatum, auribus
instillatur aurium dolorem perfecte tollit.... Ad ventrem non fluentem,
nimiumque tumescentem, Equi stercus aqua liquefactum, et percolatum,
postea bibitum, mox faciet egressum.”—(“De Equo.”)</p>

<p>Cat-dung was used in the eradication of dandruff and of scald
in the head; for excessive after-birth hemorrhages in the form of fumigation
or bath. For the relief of a person who had swallowed a bone
or thorn, his fauces were rubbed with cat-dung. For the relief of the
quartan ague, hang cat-dung and cow horn or hoof to the patient’s
arm; after the seventh attack the fever will leave him for good.—(Idem.
See under “Witchcraft,” extract from Etmuller, p. 267.)</p>

<p>Vulture-dung, mixed with the white dung of dog, cured dropsy and
palsy, especially if from a vulture which had lived on human flesh; to
be taken internally.—(“De Vulture.”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>The urine of a virgin boy or girl was an invaluable application for
affections of the eyes; also for stings of bees, wasps, and other insects.
As a cure for elephantiasis, the urine of boys was to be drunk
freely. “Ad elephantiam puerorum, pueri lotium si puer biberit
liberaliter.”</p>

<p>The crust from human urine was useful in burns and in bites of mad
dogs. (Idem. See notes on the Parisian “Mangeurs du blanc.”) For
cancers man’s ordure was burnt and sprinkled over the sore places; for
tertian fevers, it had to be that of the patient himself; and to be held
in the left hand while burning, then placed in a rag, and tied to his
left arm before the hour of the recurrence of the fever. “Ad tertianas,
ipsius ægri stercus sinistra manu sublatum comburunt et in sinistro
brachio ante horam accessionis suspendunt.”—(“De Puello et Puella
Virgine.”)</p>

<p>Hawk-dung, boiled in oil, made an excellent application for sore
eyes. (“De Accipitro.”) Crow-dung was given to children to cure
coughs, and was placed in carious teeth to cure tooth-ache.—(“De
Corvi.”)</p>

<p>Dove-dung was applied externally to tumors.—(“De Columba.”)</p>

<h3>“SAXON LEECHDOMS.”</h3>

<p>In “Saxon Leechdoms,” is arranged the medical lore of the early
centuries of the Saxon occupancy and conquest of England.</p>

<p>“Alexander of Tralles (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 550) ... guarantees, of his own experience
and the approval of almost all the best doctors, dung of a
wolf with bits of bone in it” for colic.—(“Saxon Leechdoms,” lib. i.
c. 18.)</p>

<p>“Bull’s dung was good for dropsical men; cow’s dung for women”
(vol. i. c. 12, quoting Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 68).</p>

<p>Swine-dung was applied to warts (vol. i. p. 101).</p>

<p>“For bite of any serpent, melt goat’s grease and her turd and wax,
and mingle together; work it up, so that a man may swallow it whole”
(vol. i. p. 355, quoting Sextus Flacitus).</p>

<p>For dropsy, “Let him drink buck’s mie ... best is the mie....
For sore of ears, apply goat’s mie to the ear.... Against
churnels, mingle a goat’s turd with honey ... smear therewith.”</p>

<p>“For thigh pains,” “for sore joints,” “for cancer,” “against swellings,”
“tugging of sinews,” “carbuncle,” “smear with goat’s dung”
(vol. i. pp. 355, 357).</p>

<p>“For every sore ... let one drink bull’s urine in hot water; soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
it healeth.... For a breach or fracture ... lay bull’s dung warm
on the breach.... For waters burning or fires, burn bull’s dung
and shed thereon.” (Idem, p. 369.) The word “shed” as here
employed means to urinate, apparently.</p>

<p>“For swerecothe or quinsy,” the Saxons used an external application
of the white “thost” or dung of a dog which had been gnawing a
bone before defecation (vol. ii. p. 49).</p>

<p>“Against shoulder pains, mingle a tord of an old swine.”—(Idem,
p. 63.)</p>

<p>“If a sinew shrank ... take a she-goat’s tord” (p. 69).</p>

<p>“Against swelling, take goat’s treadles sodden in sharp vinegar”
(p. 73).</p>

<h3>AVICENNA.</h3>

<p>A careful examination of a Latin edition of “Averrhoes,” Lyons,
1537, discovered nothing in regard to the medicinal use of human or
animal egestæ.</p>

<p>But, on the contrary, the works of Avicenna teem with such references;
there is hardly a page of the index to his portly volumes that
does not contain mention of stercoraceous remedies. Out of all this
abundance these selections will show that the Arabian physicians made
of such medicaments the same free use as their older brethren of the
subverted Roman empire: “Matricem mundant,” “Urina” (vol. i.
p. 330, a 38); “Sanguinem sistunt,” “Urina hominis cum cinere
vitis” (vol. i. p. 466, a 26); “Scabei,” “Scabiei ulcerosa conferunt,”
“Urina” (vol. i. p. 330, a 8); “Sciatica conferunt,” “Stercus vaccarum
et Caprarum cum adipe porci” (vol. i. p. 390, a 5); for scrofula
“Stercus Caprarum” (vol. i. p. 388, a 11); “Lentiginibus conferunt,”
“stercus lupi” (vol. i. p. 387, b 66); “Erysipelati conferunt,”
“fex urinæ hominis” (vol. i. p. 330, a 11); while for the same disease,
as well as for “excoriationi conferunt” were prescribed “stercus cameli
et pecudis” (vol. i. p. 388, a 11); “Urinæ fex,” (idem, vol. i. p. 408,
a 39); “Lapidi conferunt,” “Stercus muris cum thure” (vol. i. p. 390,
b 2); again (vol. i. p. 361, a 60); “urina porci” (vol. i. p. 408, a 66).</p>

<p>Lizard-dung an ingredient in a collyrium (vol. ii. p. 322, a 34).</p>

<p>“Matricis dolores conferunt,” “urina hominis decocta cum porris”
(vol. i. p. 408, b 1). Goat-dung “Matrici fluxui conferunt,” “stercus
caprarum siccum” (vol. i. p. 388, a 15, and vol. i. p. 390, a 50).</p>

<p>For epilepsy, one of the remedies was “stercus cameli” (vol. i. p.
338, a 6). Yellow jaundice, “Icteritias conferunt,” “urina mulieris
cum aqua mellis” (vol. i. p. 330, a 31); for burns, “Stercus caprarum
et ovium cum aceto” (vol. i. p. 389, b 62). Another remedy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
for burns was, “Stercus columbarum cum melle et semine lini” (vol.
i. p. 389, b 65).</p>

<p>“Impetigine conferunt,” “urina” (vol. i. p. 330, a 10); for ulcers,
“Stercus cameli et pecudis” (vol. i. p. 388, a 9); also for the same,
“stercus canis ab ossibus cum mellis” (vol. i. p. 390, a 2); also “urina
asini et hominis” (vol. i. p. 408, a 31); human urine again prescribed
for ulcers, in vol. i. p. 231, 646.</p>

<p>“Stercoris muris decoctio” alleviated difficulty in urination (vol. i.
p. 361, a 63). “Impetigine conferunt,” “stercus columbarum et
turdorum” (vol. i. p. 390, a 1).</p>

<p>As a cure for the wounds of Armenian arrows (9, “De sagittis Armenis”)
Avicenna says: “Jam parvenit ad me quod potus stercoris
humani est theriaca ad illud” (vol. i. p. 305, a 5). (“Theriaca”
means literary a remedy for the bites of serpents and wild beasts, but
in the present case it is used to mean a panacea.)</p>

<p>For poisonous bites, “ad morsum viperarum et omnium venenosorum
animalium” “et iterum quæ bonæ sunt” (“Medicinæ” understood)
“est stercus caprinum commixtum in vino et detur in potu” (vol. ii.
p. 227, b 36); “Urina hominis” also prescribed for the same in the
same paragraph. The dung of goats, mixed with pepper and cinnamon,
a provocative of the menses (vol. i. p. 390, a 49).</p>

<p>The dung of mice prescribed internally for the cure of running from
the ears, to aid in the expulsion of the after-birth, calculus, poison of
venomous reptiles, etc. (vol. i. pp. 361, a 58).</p>

<p>“Matrici fluxui conferunt,” “stercus caprarum siccum” (vol. i. p.
388, a 15, and vol. i. pp. 390, a 50).</p>

<p>“Spasma conferunt,” “Urina” (vol. i. p. 408, a 40); “Splenis
duritiei conferunt,” “Stercus caprarum” (vol. i. p. 30, a 50).</p>

<p>“Ano conferunt,” “Urina infantium lactentium” (vol. i. p. 408,
a 55).</p>

<p>“Stercus pecudis adustum cum aceto” was prescribed for the bite
of a mad dog (vol. i. pp. 388, a 21); “Urina cum nitro” (idem, vol. i.
p. 408, b 7); “Canis stercus pro anginæ curatione” (vol. i. p. 616,
a 59).</p>

<p>“An oyle drawne out of the excrements of Chyldren” and “An Oyle
drawne out of Manne’s Ordure,” described as medicines in the “Newe
Jewell of Health,” by George Baker, Chirurgeon, London, 1576
(Black Letter), pp. 171, 172, was prescribed for fistula and several
other ailments.</p>

<p>“Water distilled from Manne’s Ordure” was given internally for
the falling sickness, dropsy, etc.... There was also an “Oyle
drawne out of the Excrements of Chyldren,” as well as one from
“Manne’s Ordure” (see “Doctor Gesnerus, faithfully Englished,” p.
76). In the same work we read of “Water of Doue’s dung ... which
helpeth the stone” when taken internally.—(Idem p. 77.)</p>

<p>Paracelsus seems to be entitled to more credit than is generally accorded
him; he was a chemist, in the early stages of that science,
groping in the dark, but he was not the mere quack so many are
anxious to make him out to have been. He condemns the old practice
of medicine:—“The olde Physitians made very many medicines of
most filthy things, as of the filth of the eares, sweat of the body, of
women’s menstrues (and that which it is horrible to be spoken), of the
Dung of man and other beastes, spittle, urine, flies, mice, the ashes
of an owle’s head, etc.... Truly, when I consider with myself the
pride of these fooles which disdaine this metalline part of Physicke
(which after their manner, contumeliously they call Chymerican, and
therefore can neither helpe their owne nor many other diseases), I call
to mind a storie ... of Herachio Ephesio, which being sick of a leprosie,
despising the help of Physitians, anoynting himself over with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
cow-dung, set himselfe in the sun to drie, and falling asleepe was torn
to pieces by dogges.”—(Paracelsus, “Experiments,” translation of 1596,
p. 59.)</p>

<p>This last statement should be compared with the description of the
suicides of the East Indian fanatics, given under “Ordeals and Punishments.”</p>

<p>Dr. Fletcher, United States Army, states that in old medical practice
in England, from the time of Queen Elizabeth down to comparatively
modern days, consumptive patients were directed to inhale the fumes
of ordure. “Some physicians say that the smell of a jakes is good
against the plague.”—(“Ajax,” p. 74.)</p>

<p>Urine was one of the ingredients from which Paracelsus prepared
his “Crocus or Tincture of Metals.”—(See “Archidoxes,” English
translation, London, 1661, p. 59.)</p>

<p>Further on he says, “The salt of man’s urine hath an excellent
quality to cleanse; it is made thus,” etc. (p. 74). He also says:
“Man’s dung, or excrement, hath very great virtues, because it contains
in it all the noble essences, viz.: of the Food and Drink, concerning which
wonderful things might be written.”—(“Archidoxes,” lib. v. p. 74.)</p>

<p>“To distill Oyle of a Man’s Excrements, ... Take the Doung of
a young, sanguine child, or man, as much as you will.... This helpeth
the Canker and mollifieth fistulas; comforteth those that are troubled
with Alopecea.”—(“The Secrets of Physicke,” London, 1633, p. 98.)</p>

<p>“For any manner of Ache ... a plaister of Pigeon’s dung” (see
“A Rich Storehouse or Treasurie for the Diseased,” Ralph Blower,
London, 1616, black letter, p. 3); also, “Hen’s Dung” (idem, p. 4);
to provoke urine, a plaster of Horse dung was applied to the patient
(p. 25.)</p>

<p>“For spitting of blood ... the dung of mice was drunk in wine”
(idem, p. 29); for sore breasts of women, a plaster of Goose dung (p.
33); “for Burns and Scalds ... a Plaster of Sheepe’s doung,” (p. 38);
also, “the Doung of Geese” (p. 39).</p>

<p>“For deafe ears ... the pisse of a pale Goat” was poured into
them (p. 67); horse-dung was used as a face-lotion (p. 106); for the
bloody flux soak the feet in water in which “Doue’s Doung has been
seethed” (p. 119). For the gout, “Stale pisse” was an ingredient in
a composition for external application (p. 119). For stitch in the side
and back “Pigeon’s Doung” was used externally (p. 172); for sciatica,
“Oxe-Doung and Pigeon’s Doung” in equal parts, were applied as a
plaster (p. 173). Cow-dung was used internally in hydrocele (“The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
Chyrurgeon’s Closet,” London, 1632, p. 38); the urine of boys was
used as an application to ulcers in the legs (idem, p. 24); again, the
urine of immaculate boys was employed for the cure of all inveterate
ulcers (p. 27); goat-dung was applied externally for the cure of auricular
abscesses and for ulcers (pp. 35 and 42); cow-dung and dove-dung
were used in the same manner (idem p. 42); dove-dung was
also used externally in the treatment of sciatica (p. 48), and for
“Shingles” (idem p. 51). Goat-dung, externally, for tumors (p. 49);
goose-dung, externally, for canker in the breasts of women (p. 50);
swallow-dung, externally, for angina; chicken-dung for the same
(p. 58); cow-dung, externally, for tumors in the feet (p. 56); cow
and goat dung, externally, in dropsy (p. 222); and many others
throughout the volume.</p>

<p>In a black letter copy of “The Englishman’s Treasure,” London, 1641,
is given a cure for wounds, in which it is directed “To wash the wounde
very cleane with urine.”—(In Toner Collection, Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.)</p>

<p>To restrain excessive menstrual flow, apply hot plasters of horse-dung,
between the navel and the privy parts.—(See “The Englishman’s
Treasure,” by Thomas Vicary, Surgeon to King Henry VIII.,
Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth; London, 1641, p. 184; this little
volume contains nothing else of value to this work.)</p>

<p>Horse-dung was used internally for pleurisy (“Secrets in Physicke,”
by the Comtesse of Kent, London, 1654, pp. 26, 27); goose-dung, internally,
for yellow jaundice (idem, p. 37); “Hound’s Turd,” externally,
“to cure the bleeding of a Wound” (idem, p. 46); peacock’s
dung, internally, for the falling sickness or convulsions (idem, p. 56);
“The patient’s own water,” externally, for pains in the breast (p. 64);
pigeon’s dung, both internally and externally, in child-birth pains (p.
68); goose-dung, externally, for burns (p. 96); hen’s dung, externally,
for burns (p. 152); and for sore eyes (p. 174); “stale urine,”
externally, for sore feet (p. 163).</p>

<p>“The stale of a cow and the furring of a chamber-pot” to be
given, applied locally and externally, for scald head (“Most excellent
and most approved Remedies,” London, 1652, p. 80). “The Urine of
him that is sick,” externally, for stitch in the side (p. 115); goose
dung, externally, for canker in woman’s breast (p. 129); “Urin of a
Man Child (he beeing not aboue 3 years of age)” was a component in
a salve for the king’s evil (p. 132). For patients sick of the plague,
“Let them drink twice a day a draught of their own urin” (p. 143).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>“A certain countryman at Antwerp was an example of this, who,
when he came into a shop of sweet smells, he began to faint, but one
presently clapt some fresh smoking horse-dung under his nose and
fetched him to again.”—(Levinus Lemnius, “The Secret Miracles
of Nature,” Eng. translation, London, 1658, p. 107, speaking of the
effects of sweet and nasty smells upon different persons.)</p>

<p>“The urine of a Lizard, ... the dung of an elephant,” were in
medical use, according to Montaigne (“Essays,” Hazlitt’s translation,
New York, 1859, vol. iii. p. 23; art. “On the Resemblance of Children
to their Parents”). Also, “the excrement of rats beaten to powder”
(idem). The above remedies were for the stone.</p>

<p>Doctor Garrett mentions “water of amber made by Paracelsus out
of cow-dung,” and gives the recipe for its distillation, as well as for
that of its near relative, “water of dung,” the formula for which begins
with the words, “Take any kind of dung you please.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The work of Daniel Beckherius, “Medicus Microcosmus,” published
in London, in 1660, is full of the value of excrementitious remedial
agents.</p>

<p>Urine alone was applied to eradicate lice from the human head; but
a secondary application of dove’s dung was then plastered on (p. 62).
Urine was drunk as a remedy for epilepsy, used as an eye-wash, and
various other ocular affections, and dropped into the ears for various
abscesses and for deafness (pp. 63, 64).</p>

<p>A lotion of one’s own urine was good for the palsy; but where this
had been occasioned by venery, excessive drinking, or mercury, the urine
of a boy was preferable (p. 64). A drink of one’s own urine, taken
while fasting, was commended in obstructions of the liver and spleen,
and in dropsy and yellow jaundice (idem); but some preferred the
urine of a young boy (p. 65). For jaundice the remedy should be
drunk every morning, and the treatment continued for some time
(idem).</p>

<p>For retention of urine the remedy was to drink the urine of a young
girl (p. 66). Urine was drunk as a remedy for long-continued constipation
(idem); for falling of the womb stale urine was applied as a fomentation
(idem); for hysteria human ordure and stale urine were applied to
the nostrils (idem); the urine of the patient was drunk as a cure for
worms (idem); urine was used as a wash for chapped hands, also for
all cutaneous disorders (idem); also for “ficus ani” (p. 67). For gout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
in the feet the patient should bathe them in his own urine, also for
travel sores, as he would then be able to resume his journey next day
(idem).</p>

<p>One’s own urine was drunk as a preservative from the plague.
Beckherius says he knew of his own knowledge that it had been used
with wonderful success between 1620 and 1630 for this purpose.</p>

<p>Urine was recommended as a drink in lues veneris; while a sufferer
from cancer was bathed in his own urine and Roman vitriol; ulcers were
likewise bathed with the patient’s own urine (p. 68). Urine was applied
as a lotion to wounds, bruises, and contusions (p. 69). Beckherius recites
the case of a laborer who was buried under a falling mass of earth, in
1522, but, being protected by some obstruction, nourished himself for
seven days on his own urine. Besides being used alone in the above
cases, urine entered as an ingredient into medicines for old sores (p. 72);
against the growth of “wild hairs,” ocular affections, throat troubles as
gargle (p. 73), affections of the spleen (p. 74). The urine of a boy was
to be employed in paralysis and in erysipelas (idem); the urine of a
boy was also prescribed in suppression of the menses, and the urine of
a man in podagra (75). The urine of undefiled boys entered into the
composition of <i>aqua ophthalmica</i>, and was used externally in rheumatism
of the legs (p. 74).</p>

<p>The urine of boys was used as an ointment in some fevers; also as a
fomentation in tympanitis, as a plaster in dropsy, for gangrene and
podagra, in various clysters, in the cure of calculi and cachexy (pp. 78,
79); in some of the plasters cow and dove dung also entered. For the
treatment of anasarca there was a “spagyric preparation of urine.” To
make the spirit of urine by distillation, some took the urine of a
healthy man, some that of a wine-drinking boy of twelve years (pp. 81,
82). This spirit was administered in lung troubles, in dropsy, suppression
of the menses, all kinds of fevers, retention of urine, calculus,
etc. (p. 85); also in eye troubles, strangury, diabetes, podagra,
catarrh, melancholia, phrensy, cardialgia, syncope, dysentery, plague,
malignant fevers (p. 86).</p>

<p>The “spirit of urine” was again distilled with vitriol to make an
anti-podagric remedy (85).</p>

<p>Salt of urine was made by distilling the urine of a boy and collecting
the saline residuum; it was administered in cardiac troubles and to
aid in the expulsion of the dead fœtus; from it were made various empirical
remedies,—moon salt, the salt of Jove, salt of Mercury, spirit
of Orion, mercurius microcosmicus, which were used for all kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
physical infirmities (p. 87). The quintessence of urine was distilled
from the urine of a strong, healthy, chaste man of thirty years, who
had drunk heavily of wine for the occasion; by another authority it is
recommended that this happen while the sun and Jupiter may be in
“Piscibus.” This was used in calculi of the kidneys and bladder and
in all ulcerations of those parts; externally, as a lotion in gonorrhæa
and external ulcers of the private parts, for wounds and lesions of all
sorts, urinary troubles, worms, putrid fevers, and as a preservative
against the plague, for hard tumors, etc. (p. 97).</p>

<p>An “anti-epileptic spirit” had the urine of boys as its main component
(p. 95); there was an “anti-epileptic extract of the moon”
(p. 96); an “anti-podagric medicament” of the same components
almost. A “panacea solaris” had for its principal ingredient the urine
of a boy who had been drinking freely of wine (p. 97).</p>

<h3>HUMAN ORDURE.</h3>

<p>Beckherius cites a case where its use for three days cured a man of
yellow jaundice; dried, powdered, and drunk in wine, it cured febrile
paroxysms (p. 112); it was recommended to be that of a boy fed for
some time on bread and beans.</p>

<p>To smell human ordure in the morning, fasting, protected from
plague (pp. 112, 113).</p>

<p>He also gives the mode of preparing “zibethum,” or “occidental
sulphur” (p. 116).</p>

<p>As a cure for angina a mixture was prescribed containing the white
dung of dogs; also human ordure, swallow-dung, licorice, and candy
(p. 113). In cancer, human ordure was applied as a plaster, mixed
with turpentine, tobacco, antimony, powdered litharge, powdered crabs,
etc. (pp. 113, 114).</p>

<p>He also gives the formulas for preparing <i>aqua</i> and <i>oleum ex stercore
humano</i> (p. 114). In other places the use of ordure and urine in medicine
is mentioned as a matter of course.—(See p. 274; also under the
headings of “Ass,” “Mouse,” “Horse,” etc.; again, pp. 114, 192
<i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Beckherius gives a list of a number of preparations which to our
more enlightened view of such things must appear trivial, and need
not be repeated here in detail,—such as one for “extracting the
vitriol of metals,” etc. Into the preparation of all these human urine
entered.</p>

<p>Potable gold was made with a menstruum of spirits of wine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
human urine, half and half (pp. 100-102); there was an “oil of sulphur”
prepared from human urine (103); there was a “precipitate
of mercury and urine” (idem); there was finally a <i>ludum urinæ</i>, the
residuum after the distillation of the <i>aqua</i> or the <i>spiritus</i> respectively,
which was prescribed medicinally in the same way as these were
(pp. 109, 110).</p>

<p>Von Helmont called the salt obtained by the distillation of human
urine “duelech.” (See “Oritrike, or Physicke Refined,” John Baptist
von Helmont, English translation, London, 1662, pp. 847-849.) This
was the name generally given by Paracelsus to the stone in the bladder.
Von Helmont instances a cure of tympanitis or dropsy by a belly-plaster
of hot cow-dung, and adds, “Neither, therefore, doth Paracelsus
vainly commend dungs, seeing that they are the salts of putrefied
meats” (p. 520).</p>

<p>Petræus (Henricus) Nosolog. Harmon. lib. i. dissertat. 13, p. 252,
et Joh. Schæderas, pharmacop. med. chym. lib. v. p. 829, “stercus
siccatum tritum et cum melle illitum ad anguinam curandam magni
usus esse dicunt.”—(“Bib. Scatalogica,” p. 84.)</p>

<p>The ponderous tomes of Michael Etmuller contain all that was
known or believed in on this subject at the time of their publication,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1690. He gives reasons for the employment of each excrement,
solid or liquid, human or animal, which need not be detailed at this
moment.</p>

<p>Human urine. “Urina calif. exsiccat, resolvit, abstergit, discutit,
mundificat, putredini resistit, ideoque usus est præcipue intrinsecus in
obstructione epatis, lienis, vesicæ, biliaræ, pestis preservatione, hydrope,
ictero.... Exstrinsecus siccat scabiem, resolvit tumores, mundificat
vulnera etiam venenata, arcet gangrænam, solvit alvum (in
clysmata) abstergit furfures capitis.... compescit febriles insullus
(pulsui applicata) exulceratas aures sanat (instillata pueri urina) oculorum
tubedine subvenit (instillata) artuum tremorem tollit (lotione)
uvulæ tumorem discutit (gargas), lienis dolores sedat (cum cinere
cataplasmata).”</p>

<p>From the urine of a wine-drinking boy, “urina pueri (ann. 12) vinum
bibentis,” distilled over human ordure, was made “spiritus urinæ” of
great value in the expulsion of calculi, although it stunk abominably,
“sed valde fœtet.” This was employed in the treatment of gout,
asthma, calculi, and diseases of the bladder. (Etmuller, “Schroderi
Diluc.,” vol. ii. p. 265.) There are several other methods given of
obtaining this “spiritus urinæ per distillationem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>Then there was a “spiritus urinæ per putrefactionem.” To make
this, the urine of a boy twelve years old, who had been drinking wine,
was placed in a receptacle, surrounded by horse-dung for forty days,
allowed to putrefy, then decanted upon human ordure, and distilled
in an alembic, etc. There were other methods for making this also,
but this one will suffice. The resulting fluid was looked upon as
a great “anodyne” for all sorts of pains, and given both internally
and externally, as well as in scurvy, hypochondria, cachexy, yellow
and black jaundice, calculi of the kidneys and bladder, epilepsy, and
mania.</p>

<p>“Potable gold” was made from this spirit. “Idem spiritus optime
purificatus (scil. aliquoties) in aqua pluvia solvendo et distillando cumque
spiritus vini analytice unitus solvit aurum, unde aurum potabile”
(vol ii. p. 266).</p>

<p>A urine bath was good for gout in the feet. A drink of one’s own
urine was highly praised as a preservative from the plague. “Urinæ:
Potus urinæ propriæ laudatur in preservanda et curanda peste.”
Such a draught was also used by women in labor. “Urinæ hausta a
mulieribus parturientibus partum facilitat.” Clysters of urine were
administered in tympanites, or dropsy of the belly. Urine was applied
in ulcerations of the ears.</p>

<p>Saltpetre was formerly made from earth, lime, etc., saturated with
human urine, ordure, etc.</p>

<p>The “spiritus urinæ” obtained by the distillation of urine, removed
obstructions from the bladder, meatus, etc., expelled calculi, and was a
diaphoretic and an anti-scorbutic; it was likewise used in the cure of
hypochondria, cachexy, chlorosis, etc., taken internally.</p>

<p>From the distillation of vitriol and urine an anti-epileptic medicine
was obtained.—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 271.)</p>

<p>From the above-mentioned “spiritus urinæ per distillationem” was
prepared “magisterium urinæ seu microcosmi,” useful in cases of
atrophy; it also prevented the pains of the stone, if taken monthly
before the new moon.—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 266.)</p>

<p>Human ordure. “Stercus (carbon humanum Paracelsi, aliis sulph.
occiden.) emollit, maturat, anodynum est. Ea propter magni usus ad
mitigandum dolores incantatione introductos (impositum) ad anthraces
pestilentiales maturandos, ad phlegmonem, v. g. gutturis seu anginam
curandam (siccatum, tritum et cum melle illitum) ad inflammationem
vulnerum arcendam. Quin et intrinsecus a nonnullis adhibetur in angina
(crematum et potui datum), in febribus ad paroxysmos profligandos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
(eodem modo propinatum dos. 32), in epilepsia, quam stercus
primum infantuli siccatum et pulverisatum, et ad complures dies
exhibitum, radicitus evellere aiunt” (vol. ii. p. 266).</p>

<p>He alludes to the “aqua” and the “oleum” “ex stercore distillatum,”
both used in ophthalmic diseases, as cosmetics to restore color to
the face, to restore and produce hair, to cure tumors and fistulas, and
remove cicatrices, and for the cure of epilepsy. “Interne prodesse
aiunt comitialibus et hydropicis, lapidemque renum et vesicæ pellere,
morsibusque canis rabidi, venenatorumque animalium subvenire.”
The “oleum ex stercore” had to be prepared from the ordure of a
young man, not a boy, “juvenis, non pueri” (vol. ii. p. 266).</p>

<p>Etmuller tells the same story we have already had from so many
other sources, in regard to the medicinal properties ascribed to human
ordure. It was looked upon as a valuable remedy, applied as a poultice
for all inflammations and suppurations, carbuncles and pest buboes,
administered for the cure of bites of serpents, and all venomous
animals. It should be taken raw, dried, or in drink. It was the only
specific against the bites of the serpents of India, especially the “napellus,”
whose bite kills in four hours unless the patient adopts this
method of cure. It was considered a specific against the plague, and
of great use in effecting “magico-magnetic” or “sympathetic or transplantation”
cures. It was also in high repute for baffling the efforts
of witches.</p>

<p>“Water distilled from ordure was good for sore eyes, especially if the
man whose ordure was used had been fed only on bread and wine.
This was administered internally for dropsy, calculus, epilepsy, bites
of mad dogs, carbuncles, etc.” (vol. ii. p. 272).</p>

<p>“Zibetta occidentalis nihil est aliud quam stercus mediante digestione
ad suavolentiam redactum, qua Zibettam mentitur; vid. Agricola,”
vol. ii. p. 266.</p>

<p>Of the value of this “zibethum” Etmuller quotes from an older
authority: “Rosencranzerus in Astron. inferior (p. 232), dicit quod
zibethum humanum ... si illinatur parti genitali mulieris fœmina
attrahat fœtum et precaveatur abortus” (vol. ii. p. 272).</p>

<p>Human ordure, containing as it does “an anodyne sulphur, ...
destructive of acids,” was supposed to be beneficial in burns, inflammations,
and as a plaster for the dispersal of plague buboes.... “In
insulis Botiis dictis, gens quoddam serpentis repiriri, cujus morsum
mors sequatur, nisi stercus proprium demorsi mox assumatur. Tandem
aqua stercoris humani cosmetica, ab aliis ophthalmatica censetur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
sic ut et ejusdem oleum contra cancrum mammarum specifice commendatur”
(vol. ii. p. 171).</p>

<p>“In stercoribus animalium magna latet vis medica, ratione scilicet
salis volatilis; in specie stercus porcinum omnes hæmorrhagias ad
miraculum sistit, sive in forma pulveris ad ʒ i., sive in forma electuarii
adhibens; annus est quo rustica quædam post abortum insigne patiebatur
mensium profluvium cui cum meo suasu maritus inscie propinasset
stercus suillum, fluxus cessavit et mulier pristinæ reddita
sanitati. Stercus equinum summum est remedium in passione hysterica,
et doloribus colicis, si succus expressus cum cerevisia vel vino
propinetur; sic quoque conducit in variolis et morbilis infantum, propinatus
cum cerevisia calida, qui optime per sudorem expellit ut taceam
de effectu quem præstat in pleuritide laudando.</p>

<p>“Ut ita licet volatilia in uno puncto convenire videantur, diversis
tamen, ratione diversæ et specificæ cujuslibet craseus medeantur morbos.”
(vol. ii. sect. 3, “Pyrotechnia Rationalis,”—“de Animalibus,”
Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” xx.)</p>

<p>“Animalium omnium participant de natura salis ammoniaci constant
quippe (are certainly known) ex acido et alcali oleoso volatili indeque,
auræ beneficio alterantur in nitro, præsertim avium excrementa quicquid
igitur præstant, operantur ex vi salis ammoniacali” (vol. ii. p. 171).</p>

<p>The use of animal dungs was noted, but not unqualifiedly commended
by Etmuller, in the following cases: dog-dung, mixed with
honey, for inflammation of the throat; wolf-dung, in form of powder,
as an anti-colic.</p>

<p>Dog-dung (album Græcum officinalis) was regarded as useful in dysentery,
epilepsy, colic; was applied externally in angina, malignant
ulcers, hard tumors, warty growths, etc. Especial value was attached
to such dung gathered in the month of July, from a bone-fed dog,
because it was whiter, purer, and less fetid. Dog-urine was employed
as a lotion for warty growths, ulcers on the head, etc. (vol. ii. p. 253).</p>

<p>“Dicitur in officinis semper album Græcum, nunquam stercus.”
The dog “debite nutriatur cum ossibus solis, cum nullo vel pauco
potu” (vol. ii. p. 254).</p>

<p>Goat-dung was used in hard tumors of the spleen and other parts of
the body; in buboes, ear-abscesses, inveterate ulcers, dropsy, scabby
head, lichen, etc. (p. 254). In all these its use was external, but for
other troubles of the spleen, yellow jaundice, retention of the menses,
and similar ailments, it was given internally. Goat-urine was given
internally in removal of calculi, urinary troubles, and (after distillation)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
for dropsy. The egestæ of the wild goat were used for almost
identically the same disorders (vol. ii. p. 254).</p>

<p>The juice of horse-dung was used by the English in colic, pleurisy,
and hysteria.—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 254.)</p>

<p>Pig-dung, dried, snuffed up into the nostrils, cured nasal hemorrhages.
Compare this with the use made of the dried excrement of
the Grand Lama as a sternutatory and general curative.</p>

<p>Hyena-dung was used in medicine, but the diseases are not mentioned.</p>

<p>Sparrow-dung and mouse-dung, if made into pills, and taken to the
number of nine, would bring on the menses of women.</p>

<p>Cow-dung was recommended as a fomentation in gout.</p>

<p>The use of cow-dung, internally, was highly commended for expelling
calculi and for the cure of retention of urine, on account of the
“volatile nitrous salts which ascended in the alembic, and which had
a good effect upon the kidneys.”</p>

<p>The common people drank the juice expressed from this dung in all
cases of colic and pleurisy, for which they found it a beneficial medicine.
“Ulterius valde convenit ad pellendum calculum et ciendam urinam
propter sal. vol. nitrosum qui ascendit per alembicam unde ad nephritidem
et ciendam urinam valde commendatur a poterio.... Plebii
in colico dolore succum ex stercore propinant, quod verum est, non
solum in colico sed etiam in pleuritide præsentaneum remedium”
(vol. ii. pp. 249, 250).</p>

<p>The juice of young geese, gathered in the month of March, was used
in jaundice and cachexy.... Hen-dung was sometimes employed as
a substitute for goose-dung. Peacock-dung was employed in all cases
of vertigo.... Swallow-dung was used in cases of angina and inflammation
of the tonsils (vol. ii. p. 171).</p>

<p>Hawk-dung was used for sore eyes. Duck-dung “fimus morsui venenatorum
animalium imponitur” (vol. ii. p. 286).</p>

<p>Goat-dung, drunk in cases of hemorrhage.... Goat-urine considered
a specific for the expulsion of calculi of the bladder. Asses’ urine
drunk for diseases of the kidneys, atrophy, paralysis, consumption, etc.
Asses’ dung taken internally in form of powder or potion, and applied
also externally in all cases of hemorrhage, excessive uterine flow, and
troubles of that nature (vol. ii. p. 247). It was thought by some to
be best when gathered in the month of May; others thought that dog-dung
should be substituted. Cow-urine was a beneficial application
to sore eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>Cow-dung was used in all cases of burns, inflammations, rheumatism,
etc., “apum ac vesparum morsibus.” (We have already seen that it
has been used for bee stings in the State of New Jersey.) “Suffitu
reprimit uterum prolapsum.” Finally, it was used as a plaster in
dropsy.—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 248.)</p>

<p>Dove-dung was applied generally in cataplasms and rubefacient
plasters for the cure of rheumatism, headache, vertigo, colic pains,
apoplexy; also in boils, scorbutic swellings, etc., and drunk as a cure
for dropsy.—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 287.)</p>

<p>Quail-dung, “fimum in vino potum, dysenteriam sanare tradit Kynarides”
(vol. ii. p. 288).</p>

<p>Fresh calf-dung was rubbed on the skin for the cure of erysipelas.</p>

<p>Fox-dung was applied externally for the cure of all cutaneous disorders
(vol. ii. pp. 283-285).</p>

<p>Kid-dung (Capreolus or Chevreuil) was drunk as a cure for yellow
jaundice (vol. ii. p. 257).</p>

<p>Cat-dung was applied as a poultice to scab in the head and to gout
in the feet (vol. ii. p. 259).</p>

<p>Horse-dung, fresh or burnt to ashes, was applied externally as a
styptic, used as a fumigation to aid in the expulsion of the fœtus and
after-birth; also drunk as a potion for colic pains, strangulation of
the uterus, expulsion of the fœtus and after-birth, and for pleurisy.
“Stercus equinum est medicina magni et multi usus.... Interne
succus ex stercore recenti expressus.” For the certain cure of pleurisy,
it should be the dung of a young stallion, especially if oat-fed. “In
Angina certe stercus equinum non cedit stercori hirundinum ... et
canis” (vol. ii. p. 263).</p>

<p>Lion-dung, taken internally, was an anti-epileptic.</p>

<p>Hare-dung was administered internally in calculus and dysentery,
and externally for burns.</p>

<p>Hare-urine was applied in ear troubles.</p>

<p>Wolf-dung was found efficacious, taken internally, in colic.</p>

<p>Musk was frequently given, mixed with zibethum, as a carminative;
also as a nervine and a cardiac.</p>

<p>Mouse-dung found its advocates as a remedy, given internally, in
the constipation of children, calculi, used in enemata.</p>

<p>The internal administration of rat-dung removed catamenial obstructions.</p>

<p>Mouse-dung was styled “album nigrum;” dog-dung, “album
Græcum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>Sheep-dung was administered internally in yellow jaundice; “maximi
usus in aurigine, sumptum cum petroselino” (rock-parsley),—while,
externally, it was applied to hard tumors, swellings, boils,
burns, etc.</p>

<p>The urine of red or black sheep was given internally in dropsy.
“Urina (nigræ vel rubræ ovis) sumpta, aquam inter cutem abigit.”
The dose was from five to six ounces.</p>

<p>Hog-dung, externally, in cutaneous disorders, bites of venomous
animals, nasal hemorrhage,—for the cure of this last even the odor
was sufficient; “sufficit etiam odor.”</p>

<p>Michaelus Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” “Schroderi dilucidati Zoölogia,”
Lyons, 1690, vol. ii. pp. 263-279, inclusive.</p>

<p>Quail-dung was administered for epilepsy when the bird had been fed
on hellebore.—(Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” “Schrod. Diluc. Zoöl.”
vol. ii. p. 288.)</p>

<p>Cuckoo-dung, taken in drink, cured the bites of mad dogs.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>White hen-dung was preferred for medicinal purposes. It was employed
for the same ailments as dove-dung, but was not believed to be
so efficacious. It was especially valuable in colic and uterine pains, in
yellow jaundice, calculus, abscesses in the side, suppression of urine,
etc. (vol. ii. p. 289).</p>

<p>There was another cure for the bites of mad dogs,—the dung of
the swallow taken internally. It was also considered to be a cure for
colic pains and kidney troubles, and was made into a suppository in
cases of irritation of the rectum (vol. ii. p. 290).</p>

<p>Kite-dung was sometimes applied externally in pains of the joints
(vol. ii. p. 291).</p>

<p>As a purgative, starling dung is enumerated in this strange list of
filthy medicaments (vol. ii. p. 292).</p>

<p>The egestæ of wild oxen was used for the same therapeutical purposes
as the excrement of the domesticated bovines (vol. ii. p. 252).</p>

<p>Peacock-dung. “Stercus proprietate vertiginem et epilepsiam sanat
(in dies multos exhibitum).” It should be administered in wine, and
the treatment was to be persisted in from the new until the full moon,
or longer. “Continuando a novilunio usque ad plenilunium, aut amplius....
In epilepsiam est specificum magno usu expertum.” It
was likewise considered of great value in the cure of vertigo, but the
dung of the cock should be given to men; that of the hen, to women.
Etmuller, however, did not think this distinction to be necessary (vol.
ii. pp. 292, 293).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>The dung of geese, old or young, was employed in the treatment of
yellow jaundice, for which it was believed to be a specific. The dose
was one scruple. The geese should have been fed on “herba chelidonii.”
Next to the yellow jaundice, it was of special value in scurvy,
taken either in the form of a powder or a decoction. For the cure of
dropsy it was the main ingredient in several of the remedies prescribed.
It was also the principal component in the manufacture of “aqua
ophthalmica Imperatoris Maximiliani,” to prepare which, the dung of
young geese was gathered in the months of April and May (vol. ii.
p. 287).</p>

<p>Stork-dung, stercus ciconiæ. Believed to be potential in epilepsy
and diseases of the same type. “Stercus, si ex aqua hauritur, comitialibus
aliisque morbis capitis prodesse credunt.”—(Etmuller, vol. ii.
p. 287.)</p>

<p>The laxative properties of mouse-dung were extolled by Dr. Jacob
Augustine Hunerwolf, in “Ephemeridum Physico-Medicarum,” Leipzig,
1694, vol. i. p. 189.</p>

<p>Rosinus Lentilius relates that there was a certain old hypochondriac,
of fifty or more, who, in order to ease himself of an obstinate constipation,
for more than a month drank copious draughts of his own urine,
fresh and hot, but with the worst results, “Per mensem circiter urinam
suam statim a mictu calentem ipsa matuta hauriret.”—(In “Ephem.
Physico-Medicarum,” Leipzig, 1694, vol. ii. p. 169.)</p>

<p>On the page just cited and those immediately following, can be found
some ten or twelve pages of fine print, quarto, elucidative of the
uses of the human excreta, medicinally, and as a matter of morbid
appetite.</p>

<p>To the Ephemeridum, Dr. Lentilius also contributed a careful résumé
of all that was at that time known of the medicinal or other form
of the internal employment of the human excreta; he premised his
remarks by saying that while some persons sent to foreign countries
and ransacked their woods and forests for medicines, there were others
who sought their remedies nearer home, and did not disdain the employment
of the vilest excrements. “I am not speaking now,” he remarks,
“of the excrements of animals, but of human ordure and
human urine. We know,” he continues, “that horse-dung is used for
the cure of colic, pig-dung for checking internal hemorrhages, dog-dung
or album Græcum for angina, goose-dung for yellow jaundice,
peacock-dung for vertigo, and goat-dung, in Courland beer, for malignant
fevers.” The Mexicans used human ordure as an antidote against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
serpent bites in two-scruple doses, drunk in some convenient liquor:
“De homerda contra venenatos Mexicano—serpentis ictus—ad ʒ ii.
in convenienti liquore hausta” (p. 170). The same mixture was drunk
by the Japanese, as a remedy against the wounds made by poisoned
weapons: “De eadem mixtura sed e stercore proprio confusa contra
telorum venena Japonensibus pota.” Observe that in this last case
the ordure had to be that of the wounded man himself.</p>

<p>Etmuller recommends its use in expelling from the system the virus
of “napelli” whatever that may have been. To cure the plague, the
patient was to consume a quantity equal in size to a filbert. To frustrate
the effects of incantation and witchcraft, it had to be drunk in
oil. Used in the same manner, it was supposed to be of use in expelling
worms: “De eadem mixtura, sed a stercore proprio,” etc., as
already quoted. “De stercore humano, seu recente seu arido, adsunto
ad expugnandum napelli virus, etiam a nostratibus commendato, de
quo vid. Etmuller, etc.... In peste fuganda mane ad avellanas
quantitatem devorando, ... ad morbos e fascino ex aceto propinato
... ad expellendos vermes eodem modo usurpato.” He alludes also
to “Oletum” and the medicines made with it, as an ingredient; but
says he will leave “Zibethum” and “Occidental Sulphur” to Paracelsus
and the members of his school. He quotes Galen as recommending
the drinking of the urine of a stout, healthy boy, as a preventive of the
plague. “Urina pueri sani bibita ... preservans a peste,” quoting Galen,
lib. x. “De Simp. Med. Fac.” A draught of her husband’s urine was
of great assistance to a woman in uterine troubles: “Sic, in δυσοχία
urinæ maritalis haustum concelebrant alii.” The urine of a chaste boy
was much commended by many writers for internal use in dropsy,
splenic inflammation, etc. “Sic urinam impolluti pueri quotidie potum,
esse medicamentum laudabile et præsentaneum, ad lienis morbos et
hydropem.” It would be useless to quote further in the words of the
original. Lentilius goes on to say that a potion of one’s own urine
was extolled in the treatment of the bites of snakes, wounds by deadly
weapons, incipient dropsy and consumption.</p>

<p>To drink one’s own urine for the space of three days was a sure cure
for the yellow jaundice, also in preserving from the plague. But Von
Helmont was of the opinion that in this last case its virtues were
derived from the fact that it was a stimulant and served to keep up
the spirits. By Etmuller, its use was strongly recommended in the
treatment of the yellow jaundice, etc. (citing Etmuller). It was likewise
highly extolled by Avicenna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>We are next treated to a feast of big words, in which we learn that
on account of its “nitrosity” and “volatility,” it was regarded as a
“detersive,” and “penetrative,” while, on account of the alkali it contained,
it was a neutralizer of the “fermenting acids,” and therefore
applicable in cardialgia, anorexia, gout, toothache, colic, yellow jaundice,
and intermittent fevers, either the urine “of the patient himself
or that of a wine-drinking boy.”</p>

<p>Boyle, the eminent philosopher, is quoted as saying that, in his
opinion, the virtues of human urine, as a medicine, internally and externally,
would require a volume by themselves. Boyle is also credited
with having published a tract on this subject, in Leipzig, 1692, over
the signature “B.”</p>

<p>Lentilius devotes a number of pages of close, logical reasoning to
demonstrate the fallacy of supposing that human excreta can be of any
possible utility in therapeutics. According to his opinion, Nature
voided them from the body because the body had no further use for
them; therefore, their re-absorption could scarcely be other than
deleterious; this was all the more true in disease, because the patient
being in a morbid state, that which he ejected could by no process of
correct reasoning be regarded as healthy. This argument, although of
great interest and value, is very long and pertains rather to the history
of medicine proper than to this essay.</p>

<p>Lentilius concludes by saying that no more cruel threat could be
made than that of Sennacherib against the Jews that he would make
them eat their own excrement and drink the water which bathed his
feet: “Quam futurum esse, ut quisquis sua stercora voraturus, et
aquam pedum suorum bibiturus sit.” Esa. 36, ver. 12. “Væ miseris
ægrotis, quo rumores ad urinæ potum rediit.”—(In “Ephem.
Phys. Medic.” Leipzig, 1694, vol. ii. pp. 169 to 176, inclusive; the
pages are quarto, the number of words to the page about 375.)</p>

<p>Lentilius has either stolen bodily from Paullini, or anticipated him;
he has all of Paullini’s facts, but seems, in addition, to have been
much of a philosopher, which Paullini was not.</p>

<p>Christian Franz Paullini’s “Filth Pharmacy,” Frankfort, 1696, is
better known than any other of the works cited, being in German, of
small size, and confining itself almost exclusively to a recapitulation of
diseases, with the appropriate excrementitious curative opposite each.</p>

<p>Six different editions are contained in the Library of the U. S. Army
Medical Museum, in Washington; of these, that of Frankfort, 1696
(268 pages, duodecimo), was selected, and the work of translation entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
to Messrs. Smith and Pratz; being perfectly familiar with English
and German, their interpretation, made slowly and carefully, may
be relied on as minutely correct.</p>

<p>Paullini has done nothing beyond collecting his ample list of cases
in which the human and animal excreta were employed in the treatment
of diseases; he has in no instance ventured upon an explanation
of the reason for such use, such as Etmuller supplied.</p>

<p>He treats of the employment of human ordure and urine, and animal
excreta, in the following diseases: headache, insomnia, vertigo, dementia,
melancholia, mania, gout, convulsions, palsy, epilepsy, sore eyes,
cataract, ophthalmia, ear troubles, bleeding of the nose, nasal polypi,
carious teeth, dropsy of the head, wens, asthmatic troubles, coughs,
spitting of blood, consumption, pleurisy, fainting spells, diseases of the
mammary glands, tumors, colic, abnormal appetite, worms, hernia,
sciatica, ulceration of the bowels, constipation, diarrhœa, dysentery,
obstructions of the liver, dropsy, jaundice, kidney troubles, gravel,
stone, retention of urine, excessive flow of urine, impaired virility,
swelling of the testicles, uterine displacements, menstrual troubles,
sterility, accidents to pregnant women, miscarriages, difficult labor,
pains after childbirth, gout of feet, rheumatism, fevers of all kinds,
poisons, plague, syphilitic and venereal diseases, abscesses, sprains, contusions,
bruises, wounds, ring-worm, felons, itch, freckles, as a cosmetic,
for rash, tetter, loss of hair, lice, gangrene, colds, warts, fissure of the
rectum, fistulas, corns, bunions, love-potions, and to baffle witchcraft.</p>

<p>For headache, pigeon-dung was used internally, and the dung of a
red cow and of the peacock, externally.</p>

<p>Insomnia, donkey-dung, internally; gout and pigeon dung, externally.
Human urine was also used for the same purpose (pp. 28, 29).</p>

<p>Palsy. Let the patient wash with his own urine or that of a young
boy (pp. 28, 29); administer peacock’s or horse’s dung internally.</p>

<p>For the cure of the dread disease, epilepsy, human ordure and the
urine of boys were administered internally, and there were likewise internal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
applications of the dung of horses, peacocks, mice, dogs, black
cows, lions, storks, and wild hogs; no external applications are noted
for this disease (pp. 28, 29, 42, 43).</p>

<p>Another remedy for epilepsy was to take the excrements of a fine,
healthy youth, dry them, and extract the oil by means of heat; rectify
this oil and take inwardly (pp. 42, 43).</p>

<p>For inflamed and running eyes make a collyrium of the warm urine
of young boys, mingled with other ingredients. Make an external application
of boys’ urine, or of the dung of swallows, pigeons, cows,
goats, prairie hens, horses, lizards, doves. There was no internal administration
of any of the above suggested.</p>

<p>For ophthalmic troubles, the same treatment as the above.</p>

<p>Cataract. Make an external application of human ordure, of boy’s
urine, or of the dung of wolves, green lizards, or geese.</p>

<p>Consumption. The patient’s ordure, internally; his own or a boy’s
urine, or mice-dung, internally (pp. 74, 75).</p>

<p>Another remedy for consumption was to let the patient drink a mixture
of his own urine beaten up with fresh egg; repeat for several
successive mornings; also, let him eat his own excrement (pp. 74,
76).</p>

<p>For pleurisy, we read that there was an external application of the
patient’s own urine, or that the dung of donkeys, horses, stallions,
mares, hens, pigeons, and dogs was given internally.</p>

externally.</p>

<p>A youth in Leyden fell madly in love with a young girl, but could
not get the consent of his parents to marry her. He was seized with
a violent fever and constipation. In this desperate condition he imagined
that a drink of fresh urine from his beloved would benefit him;
he accordingly wrote to her, begging her to satisfy his longing, which
she accordingly granted, and after drinking of the beverage to his
heart’s content, he found immediate relief (whether from the constipation
or the passion Paullini neglects to state).—(Paullini, pp. 106,
107.)</p>

goose-dung, internally; sheep-dung, externally; donkey or deer dung,
internally.</p>

<p>Kidney diseases, stone in the bladder. Take internally human urine
or water, distilled over human ordure, or the dried catamenia of

Human excrement was applied outwardly in treatment of falling of the
womb; this was also considered a good method of treating inflammation
of the vagina; stale urine and the steam of old socks, and asses’
dung, was applied outwardly. The scrapings of chamber vessels was
taken inwardly, mixed with other ingredients (pp. 154, 155).</p>

<p>For menstrual troubles menstrual blood was administered internally;
the urine of boys, internally; the excreta of donkeys and rabbits,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
both internally and externally; and those of hogs, rats, and horses,

and let the patient make water upon it and take the fume thereof at
his nose and mouth, using this three days together, and it will cure
him (of yellow jaundice).”—(“The Poor Man’s Physician,” John

<p>Schurig’s “Chylologia,” published in Dresden, 1725, contains citations
from nearly seven hundred authorities. As these are nearly all
of very ancient date, and only in a few cases accessible to scholars
restricted to American libraries, this learned work of Schurig becomes
all the more valuable to such as desire to study intelligently and
profoundly this subject of the use of human and animal excreta in
religious rites or in religious medicine.</p>

<p>Some of the writers quoted by Schurig favor, others oppose the
medical employment of the human excretions. Among those in favor
of it, according to him, may be seen the names of Galen and Dioscorides.
In Schurig’s day there seems to have been much opposition
developing, especially when other remedies were available; although
Schurig says that the Dutch soldiers returning from the Indies spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
in praise of what they had seen there of the use of such medicaments.
Among European practitioners, human ordure was employed alone,
mixed with water or other ingredients, or a water and an oil were
distilled from it.</p>

<p>It would be a useless task to repeat the names of all the authorities
mentioned by this learned German, or to give in detail all the prescriptions
in which the alvine dejecta figure as components. Their
insertion here would add nothing to the value of these notes, as they
are strictly pharmaceutical in their spirit; it may, however, be of
some interest to the student to learn just what diseases were supposed
to be amenable to this course of treatment, and just how the curatives
were to be administered.</p>

<p>For angina pectoris, the ordure passed by a young boy after eating
lupines, to be taken internally (p. 758). For the same disease there
were other recipes for ordure in pills, plasters, and decoctions, as well
as for electuaries of ordure, to be blended with honey (p. 756).</p>

<p>For bringing boils, ulcers, etc., to a head, for sprains, luxations,
etc., a poultice of human ordure, applied hot, was considered the best
specific (p. 757).</p>

<p>For rheumatic gout, a hot poultice of human ordure was considered
of value (p. 757).</p>

<p>Renal calculi. “Aqua ex stercore distillata” was given internally
(p. 757). For cancers and malign ulcers, human ordure was used as
a local poultice; also given internally, in pills or powders. Pope
Benedict was cured of a cancer by this treatment (pp. 758, 759).</p>

<p>Epilepsy. Peacock-dung was used internally in conjunction with
human ordure (p. 762).</p>

<p>Erysipelas was treated with a poultice of human ordure (p. 762).
“Oleum ex stercore distillatum” was also given internally (p. 762).</p>

<p>Cicatrices, small-pox pustules. Bathe with “aqua ex stercore distillata”
(p. 760).</p>

<p>Gangrene, cured by application of warm ordure and urine (p. 763).</p>

<p>Dropsy; use “aqua ex stercore distillata” internally (p. 764).</p>

<p>Yellow jaundice, by human ordure drunk in wine (p. 764). Here
he quotes Paullini, and others with whom we are already familiar.</p>

<p>Piles. Plaster of human ordure (p. 766). The same method of
treatment for tumors (p. 777).</p>

<p>Ring-worm and other skin diseases. Use “oleum ex stercore”
internally (p. 766).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>Inflammation of the breasts of young mothers; local application
of human ordure (p. 767).</p>

<p>Burns and scalds. “Aqua ex stercore” locally (p. 760). Inflammations,
ditto (p. 766).</p>

<p>Dysentery. “Aqua ex stercore” internally (p. 761), quoting
Paullini.</p>

<p>Empyematis. “Oleum ex stercore,” internally (p. 761).</p>

<p>Epilepsy. “Cured and prevented by excrement. infantis,” internally
(p. 761).</p>

<p>For all fevers. Ordure, mixed with honey, internally, quoting
Paullini (pp. 762, 763).</p>

<p>Fistula in ano or in lachryma. Local application of human ordure
(p. 763).</p>

<p>Birth-marks were effaced by a plaster of human ordure, or of meconium
(p. 771).</p>

<p>Ophthalmia, cataract, etc. Human ordure, applied as a plaster.
Also, “aqua ex stercore distillata,” internally (p. 771).</p>

<p>Toothache. Plaster of human ordure, mixed with powdered chamomile
flowers, quoting Paullini (p. 772).</p>

<p>Œdema. Plaster of human ordure and of cow-dung (p. 772).</p>

<p>Felons. Plaster of human ordure. Also, one of the same, mixed
with assafœtida, quoting Paullini (p. 772).</p>

<p>Hysteria. Human ordure, drunk in wine (p. 773).</p>

<p>Bites of mad dogs, serpents, and all wild animals. Ordure, or
“oleum ex stercore distillatum,” or “aqua ex stercore distillata,” internally
(pp. 767, 768).</p>

<p>In the island of Manilla, human ordure was held in such high estimation
as a remedy for the cure of the bites of all venomous animals,
that it was carried fresh, or dessicated, in little pyxes or pouches suspended
from the neck, ready for instant use. An example is given,
on the authority of a Franciscan friar, for years a missionary in that
country, of a man so bitten, and so near death that he could not open
his mouth, whose teeth were pried asunder, and this remedy inserted.
He recovered immediately.</p>

<p>Human ordure was also used internally, in Mexico, for the cure
of serpent bites, as we have learned previously from other sources.
(p. 767.)</p>

<p>For worms in the head. “Oleum ex stercore distillatum,” applied
locally (p. 777).</p>

<p>Poisons. Human ordure, internally (pp. 777, 778).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>For wounds occasioned by poisoned weapons, in the island of Macassar,
human ordure was administered internally, until vomiting was
induced. The same treatment was observed in Armenia, while in
Celebes it was the recognized antidote against vegetable poisons,
quoting Paullini (pp. 778, 779).</p>

<p>Plague. Human ordure and human urine were mixed together,
and taken internally, to cure or prevent the plague. Human ordure
was also taken alone, in the form of pills, and applied to plague buboes
as a plaster. Schurig says he personally knew a certain clergyman in
Dresden, in 1680, who took such pills with good effect (p. 775).</p>

<p>Scabs and tetter, local applications of “oleum ex stercore distil.”
(p. 776).</p>

<p>Pleurisy, “Ol. ex sterc. dist.,” internally (p. 774).</p>

<p>Gout. Human ordure as a plaster, and also internally (p. 775); here
he again cites Paullini, among others not known to us.</p>

<h3>SCHURIG’S IDEAS REGARDING THE USE IN MEDICINE OF THE EGESTÆ
OF ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>Schurig devotes the fourteenth chapter of his work to a treatise “De
Stercoribus Brutorum.” It is unnecessary to enter much into detail
upon this point; it will be sufficient to give only a small number of
the recipes, with notes upon the manner of administering, and, where
possible, the opinions expressed in regard to their efficacy.</p>

<p>From these we may be enabled to form some idea of the line of medical
thought of the ancient practitioners.</p>

<p>Beginning with goose-dung, we find it commended as warm and
drying in its effects; an aperient and endowed with power over the
menses; also over the after-birth and urine; and hence of value in
jaundice, scurvy, and dropsy. It was also employed in many other
diseases, principally in fevers, in whooping-cough, in cachexy, liver
troubles, and when applied externally as a plaster, was of such value
in the treatment of sore eyes that the Emperor Maximilian resorted
to its use with the greatest advantage; again, applied as a plaster, it
was used in angina and in mammary cancer. The dung of young
geese was regarded as the best, and it should be gathered when possible
in the early spring, preferably in the month of March, while
still “green,” on the meadows; most of the old prescriptions insist
upon this, as will be seen from the sample given in this paragraph.</p>

<p>The dose of the dried powder was from half a dram to a full dram,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
and it was administered in wine, or mixed with cinnamon and sugar.
It was frequently combined with hen-dung, or diluted with the
urine of she-goats or he-calves. Some practitioners doubted whether
it was superior to dove-dung for the same diseases. When used in
whooping-cough or throat swellings, it was placed under the tongue
of the patient. The following are the words with which Schurig begins
his panegyric upon its virtues:—</p>

<p>“Calefacit et siccat vehementer; incidit, aperit; menses, secundinas,
et urinas potenter movet; hinc maximi usus est in morbo regio, scorbuto,
et hydrope.”</p>

<p>Asses’ dung was considered by Schurig to be an especially good
remedy in all diseases of hemorrhage. “Singulare remedium contra
quamvis hæmorrhagias” (p. 800); but it had to be collected in the
month of May; “Stercus asininum in Majo collectum.” It was to be
taken in doses of one or more drachms, or only the juice squeezed from
it into some medicinal water.</p>

<p>Dried in the sun, or in a warm place, it was good for bleeding at the
nose; “ad solem vel in loco calido exsiccetur et fiat pulvis qui per
nares attractus subito illarum hæmorrhagias compescit.” It was regarded
as an infallible remedy for restraining an excessive menstrual
flow. “Infallibile remedium ad constringendum fluxum menstruum
esse stercus asininum ... asserit Johannes Petrus Albrechtus.”</p>

<p>This dung was also in great vogue in all cases of uterine inflammation,
applied locally as a plaster. It was administered both internally
and externally for gout of the feet, and used as a component of a
plaster for dropsy. It was given internally for colic. Collected in the
month of May, it was administered internally to dissolve calculi.
“Stercus bubulum mense Majo collectum miram præbet aquam adversus
Calculos, quos solvit et una urinam movet, quam nigram prima die
pellit, calculis vehementer attritis. Hæc aqua in officinis vocatur omnium
florum.” This water, known officinally as “water of all-flowers,”
was used in attacks of plague, and in cases of gangrene, inflammation,
rheumatism, etc.; also in dropsy and in cancerous ulcers (p. 800
<i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<p>Schurig devotes considerable space to the dung of dogs, called by
some “Flowers of Melampius,” and by others by the “more honest
name of album Græcum.” “Stercus caninum, quod nonnulli flores
Melampi, pharmacopœi autem honestiore nomine album Græcum vocant
(to differentiate it from the black, which was the dung of mice),
ad differentiam nigri, quod est muscerda” (p. 803).</p>

<p>He believed that it was in its effects “drying, cleansing, solvent,
an aperient, a dissipater of swellings, such as carbuncles, a solver of
ulcers,—hence useful in dysentery, in epilepsy, colic, and such complaints,
as well as in angina, guttæ, malignant ulcers, hard tumors,
dropsy, warts, etc.” “Siccat, abstergit, discutit, aperit, apostemata
rumpit, exulceratione abstergit, hinc utile est in Dysenteria, quin etiam
in Epilepsia, dolore colico, et similibus;” also “in anginæ, gutturi, ulceribus
malignis, tumores duros, hydropicas, verrucas, etc.” Also in
fistulas, inflammation of the tonsils, etc. It was applied externally
to malignant ulcers by being sprinkled upon them, or as a plaster;
applied also as a plaster in dropsy. It was used in combination with
the dung of swallows (“stercus hirundinum”), or of owls (“noctuæ”).
Used as a gargle in throat trouble (pp. 803-807).</p>

<p>“Album Græcum” was considered best when obtained from “white”
dogs, as they were supposed to have the soundest constitutions. This
was especially the case in the treatment of epilepsy (p. 80). Here we
have a very decided trace of “Color Symbolism.”</p>

<p>“Album Græcum” was taken, preferentially, from dogs which, for
at least three days previously, had been nourished on hard bones, with
the least possible amount of water to drink; such dung was hard, white,
and of faint odor, “durum, album, nec graviter olet.” Some of the
prescriptions call for the dung of a fasting dog; “stercum canis per
jejunium emaciati” (p. 806).</p>

<p>Schurig tells us that the dung of the goat was used both internally
and externally in medicine. It was believed to be efficacious in the
expulsion of calculi, in the reduction of hard tumors, in the dissipation
of tetter, ring-worm, scald, leprosy, abscesses behind the ears, bites of
serpents and other wild animals, in the restriction of excessive catamenial
flow, etc. It was applied as a plaster in the treatment of tumors
in the limbs, swellings of the testicles, in gout, œdema, cancer,
inflammatory rheumatism, carbuncles, atrophy of the muscles, tumors
in the mammæ, etc. But when made into a plaster, was frequently
mixed with the patient’s own urine (p. 809).</p>

<p>Schurig pronounces it a rubefacient; it was of use in alleviating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
rheumatic pains, headache, vertigo, pains in side, shoulders, brain, and
loins, colic, apoplexy, lethargy; it was supposed to be able to dissolve
scrofulous and all other tumors, and was beneficial in the treatment of
gout; used internally, it expelled dropsical water through the urine
and also dissolved calculi; as a plaster, it was used in the cure of the
bites of mad dogs; likewise for scald head; internally, the Austrian
midwives employed it in the treatment of hysteria; while, throughout
Germany, it was administered in cases of suppression of the menses
(p. 809 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>As to horse-dung, Schurig has to say that either it or the juice
extracted from it was drunk to aid in easing the pains of colic, to assist
in the expulsion of the placenta, or of a dead fœtus, or in cases of strangulation
of the uterus; externally, it was believed to be serviceable in
restraining eruptions of the blood. To be of the greatest medicinal
value, this dung should be taken from a stallion fed on oats. It was
regarded as of great value in developing small-pox pustules upon women
and children (p. 812 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>A rustic remedy which seems to have had a wide dissemination, for
the alleviation of the cramp-colic, was composed of the juice expressed
from horse-dung, mixed with warm beer, taken internally, while at the
same time there was applied to the region of the umbilicus a plaster
of warm horse-dung and hot ashes; such a plaster was employed
in the cure of pleurisy among the English. In the same disease a
mixture of warm horse-dung and beer was taken both internally and
externally.</p>

<p>Cat-dung, in wine, formed the remedy in cases of vertigo and epilepsy.
While its use was recommended principally in external applications,
there were not wanting those who relied upon it mainly in
internal application. It was reputed to possess especial efficacy in
loss of hair, and supposed to be serviceable in preventing baldness,
applied as an unguent. Administered internally, it suppressed immoderate
menstrual flow. For the cure of felons, which so many in those
days believed to be occasioned by a small worm, it was of certain efficacy,
if bound round the afflicted thumb or finger. Paullini is quoted
as having had personal experience with felons thus cured. But Paullini
himself was of opinion that the dung of the goose was of equal
value with that of the cat in this case (p. 815).</p>

<p>Hen-dung was recommended for use in burns. It was regarded as
beneficial against magic philters, “in specie ex sanguine menstruo
fœmineo.” It was considered good for all those ailments for which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
dove-dung was prescribed, but was not quite so efficacious. It was excellent
for colic, for uterine pangs, yellow jaundice, calculus, suppression
of urine, for all pains in the bowels, for strangling of the womb
and pains therein, for poison, witchcraft, for seat-worms, etc. Externally,
it was applied for all sores in the eyes, ulcers, warts, cicatrices,
piles, pains in the feet and arms (pp. 816, 817).</p>

<p>Swallow-dung is mentioned as of internal and external application.
It was regarded of great efficacy in the treatment of mad-dog bites,
quaternary fevers, colic, inflammation of the kidneys, etc. It was applied
as a plaster in cases of headache, angina, inflammation of the tonsils,
and as a suppository in relaxation of the rectum. Its efficacy was
conceded in dyeing the hair, being invaluable when used frequently as
an unguent. Etmuller is quoted as expressing the opinion that they
owe their action to the presence of “Armoniacal” salts. The swallow’s
nest, with all its contents, was also sometimes ground up into a plaster,
and swallow-dung itself was occasionally substituted for “album
Græcum” (pp. 817 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>Lion-dung exerted its potency in cases of difficult labor, and it was
the panacea against epilepsy and apoplexy. One of the Grand Dukes
of Austria was cured of epilepsy by its use. Preference was given to
the excrement of a female lion, except where she had just brought
forth young. An anti-epileptic remedy of great repute was composed
of burnt crow’s-nest, burnt tortoise, burnt human skulls, linden-tree
bark, and lion-dung, made into an infusion by long digestion in spirits
of wine (pp. 819, 820).</p>

<p>Leopard’s dung dissolved calculi; was taken as a potion for the cure
of dysentery; applied as a plaster for the cure of burns; hernia was
cured by a bolus composed of leopard’s dung, human mummy, burnt
worms, syrup, and other ingredients. The ashes of the dung, skin,
and hair of the leopard, in combination, expelled calculi. This remedy
should be drunk, dissolved in wine; it was also a sure remedy for the
most obstinate cases of colic. It was applied externally in sciatica,
also in constriction of the vulva, and was employed to facilitate conception.
In the last-named instance pastilles (trochisci) were likewise
made and the parts fumigated. Or a pessary was inserted and
kept in place for three days and nights; “et quamvis antea sterilis
fuerit, deinceps tamen concipiet.” To prevent falling out of eye-lashes
and eye-brows, an ointment was prepared of which the dung of
the leopard was an ingredient. Finally, it was in esteem as an aphrodisiac,
and to expel wind from the womb (p. 820).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>Wolf-dung, drunk in wine, or taken as a powder, in doses of one
scruple or more, was used in the treatment of the colic. Paullini is
quoted as recommending its use in fevers. The dung of wolves, as
of dogs, should, if possible, be that which is white in color, dejected by
animals which have been feeding upon bones, and deposited upon
rocks, thorns, bushes, or the lower branches of trees, but not on the
ground. It was employed internally in pains in the limbs, and administered,
also internally, in form of powder, in attacks of vertigo.
Desiccated, it was blown into eyes afflicted with cataract. The cavities
of carious teeth were filled with wolf-dung, to ease the pains of tooth-ache.
For nasal hemorrhage, the smoke of burning wolf-dung was
snuffed up into the nostrils; but another prescription was to drink an
infusion of wolf-dung in red wine. If sheep detected the odor of wolf-dung
about their paddocks, or folds, they would behave as if bewitched,
running from side to side, bleating and showing as much terror as if
their arch-enemy, the wolf, was himself at hand. Knowing this fact,
rascally mountebanks were wont to perpetrate tricks upon the ignorant
and unsuspecting rustics, by secreting some of this dung in the stable
with the ewes and lambs, frightening them out of their wits, and then
persuading their masters that their flocks were suffering from some
hidden ailment for the cure of which they would demand a big fee in
money or fat sheep.</p>

<p>Schurig recommends the use of mouse-dung, both internally and externally,
for various disorders, for constipation in children, for scald
head, and dandruff, in which cases it was applied as an ointment, for
the elimination of calculi in kidneys and bladder, for all swellings in
the fundament, piles, warts, tumors in ano, hemorrhages of the lungs,
for the suppression of the menses, and even to excite the growth of the
beard. When taken internally, it was administered in broth, milk, or
panada; externally, it was made into a plaster with butter and such
ingredients. It was at times mixed with the dung of sparrows (p. 823
<i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>Sheep-dung figures in medicinal preparations, to be used either internally
or externally. Internally, as a decoction, in yellow jaundice,
obstructions and constipation of the bowels, and in small pox. Also
as a specific in the cure of gonorrhœa, when given in form of pills.
For pains in the intestines, for swellings, burns, and ingrowing toe-nails,
it was applied as a plaster (p. 826 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>Peacock-dung, the great specific in all cases of epilepsy and vertigo,
was administered in doses of one dram, and in France was held in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
high repute for such purposes. It should be used from the new to the
full moon, and be taken in white wine (p. 828).</p>

<p>This paragraph about the medicinal value of the droppings of the
peacock deserves more than a cursory glance; in it we have a strong
suggestion of the former association of this bird with moon worship.
The peacock, we know, was the bird that drew the car of Juno, and
that goddess was as much a lunar deity as Diana.</p>

<p>Pig-dung or swine-dung appears as one of the remedies, of both
internal and external application, for nasal hemorrhage, and uterine
flux. For nasal hemorrhages, it was dried and reduced to powder, and
drawn up into the nostrils as a sort of snuff. Applied, externally,
warm, to the vulva, it was regarded as an aid in hemorrhage of the
uterus; it was also given internally for the same purpose. It was not
used exclusively for such hemorrhages, but had a great repute as a
styptic in general, and was applied to wounds of all descriptions. It
was therefore used both externally and internally for the suppression
of excessive menstrual flow, and taken internally to restrain spitting of
blood. It was of general use in the treatment of felons, and was also
regarded as an invaluable febrifuge.</p>

<p>For nasal hemorrhage, it was occasionally bound round the temples.
Oddly enough, it was believed to be a remedy for fetor of breath.
“Alii miscent stercus porcinum exsiccatum, cum pulvere rosarum pro
corrigendo fœtore” (p. 830 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>As an external application for tumors of all kinds, cow-dung had a
host of advocates, who likewise extended its use to the cure of scrofulous
sores. For scrofulous wens, there was a cataplasm made of a composition
of various dungs,—those of the cow, goat, and doves, among
others. This was also to be taken internally, in white wine.</p>

<p>A plaster of cow-dung was used in gout of the feet. The dung of
grass-fed cows was considered excellent for tumors, etc.; but its efficacy
was increased when mixed with cow-urine or the urine of the
patient himself; this was also in request for the treatment of œdema.
For the stings of bees and wasps, a plaster of cow-dung was frequently
used: “Contra apum et vesparum ictus, stercus vaccinum cum aceto
utiliter adhibetur” (p. 837). The dung of a black cow, burned and
given in scruple doses to a newly born child, preserved it from epilepsy
and consumption; it was also employed to mitigate the pains of dentition.
The dung of bulls and cows, collected in the month of May,
distilled with water, made a panacea for kidney diseases; it also expelled
calculi and induced a flow of urine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>“Hæc aqua vocatur aqua omnium florum,” was employed both internally
and externally in gangrene, inflammations, rheumatism, spasms,
dropsy, suppression of urine, etc., and was used externally to remove
freckles and as a general cosmetic.—(“Chylologia,” p. 835 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>In the “Complete English Physician,” London, 1730, there are
recipes which include the dung of geese, dogs, doves, horses, peacocks,
hogs, and cows.</p>

<p>In the “Complete English Dispensatory” of John Quincy, London,
1730, p. 307, under the head “Distillation of Urine,” it is alleged that
the salts obtained from the urine “of a sound young man, newly
made,” was beneficial in rheumatism and arthritis. “Urina hominis,—urine
of a man. Some have got a notion of this being good for the
scurvy, and drink their own water for that end, but I cannot see with
what reason. Some commend it boiled into the consistence of honey,
for rheumatic pain, rubbing it onto the part affected; in which case
it may do good, because it cannot but be very penetrating.... Urina
vaccæ,—cow piss. Some drink this as a purge. It will operate violently,
but it is practised only among the ordinary people, and has
nothing in its virtues to prefer it to more convenient and cleanly medicines,
any more than the former” (pp. 248, 249).</p>

<p>Father Du Halde says of camel’s dung: “When it is dried and reduced
to a powder, it will stop bleeding of the nose by being blown
into it.”—(Chinese recipes given in Du Halde’s “History of China,”
London, 1736, vol. iv. p. 34.)</p>

<p>“The dung (of sheep) is a prevalent medicine against the jaundice,
dropsy, cholick, pleurisy, spleen, stone, gravel, scurvy, etc., taken either
in powder, tincture, or decoction. The dung, made into a cataplasm
with camphire, sal armoniack, and a little wine, opens, digests, attenuates
and eases pain. It is excellent in abscesses about the ears
and other emunctories, swellings in women’s breasts, pain of the spleen,
and gout.”—(Pomet, “History of Drugs,” English translation, London,
1738, p. 256.)</p>

<p>The rare and erudite pamphlet of Samuel Augustus Flemming, “De
Remediis ex Corpore Humano desumtis,” Erfurt, 1738, although containing
not more than thirty-two pages, is filled with a mass of curious
information upon subjects generally disregarded. Flemming remarks
that those who could use urine, calculi, and things of that kind in
medical practice, should not shrink from the employment of ordure as
well. “And it is truly wonderful,” he says, “that a substance, the
very aspect and odor of which are sufficient to induce an inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
nausea, should be regarded not merely as a matter of curiosity and
study, but held in the highest repute as a unique and most precious
treasure for the preservation of health.”</p>

<p>Yet Paracelsus, and others of his school, knowing the natural repugnance
to the acceptance of such medicines, prepared it under the
name of “Zibethum Occidentalis,” and administered it in doses of
from one to two drams, given in honey or wine, to ward off attacks of
fever; by others, it was employed as a plaster in cases of throat-inflammation,
being then called “Aureum.” Others again were of the
opinion, from an examination of its chemical nature, that it was fairly
entitled to a place in the Materia Medica. An oil and water were distilled
from it, and used in ocular sores, corrosive ulcers, and all sorts
of fistulas; for affections of the scalp, for the ulcers of erysipelas, for
ring-worm and tetter, and especially the pains of gout. Finally, it was
believed by many to be of exceptional efficacy in the cure of the plague,
being taken internally.</p>

<p>“Qui urina, calculi et aliis delectantur, non a stercore ipso abhorrebunt,”
etc. The full citation in Latin need not be repeated, as it is
expressed in much the same manner as the views of Schurig, Paullini,
Etmuller, Beckherius, and others on the same subject. He cites
Zacutus Lusitanus Poterus and Johannes Anglicanus, neither of whose
writings are to be found in America.</p>

<p>Speaking of human urine, Flemming says that physicians boasted
not only of their ability to diagnose disease from urine, but to use the
fluid itself in the treatment of disease. It was employed in two ways:
either in the raw state, as emitted from the person in due course of
nature, or in chemical preparations extracted from it. It was often
administered with beneficial results in dropsy as an enema. In difficult
labor, a draught of the husband’s urine taken warm brought easy
and safe delivery.</p>

<p>A drink of the patient’s own urine was highly commended in hysteria.
As an external application for the eradication of dandruff, scab,
and other scalp troubles, it was held in high esteem among the common
people.</p>

<p>A salt and a spirit were prepared from urine by distillation, and
highly spoken of in the treatment of frenzy, mania, and kindred mental
infirmities of a grave type.</p>

<p>Flemming quotes from Beckherius, whose writings have already
been presented, and from Quercetanus, in “Pharmac. dogmat.,”
p. 119.</p>

<p>In the “Physiological Memoirs of Surgeon-General Hammond, U. S.
Army,” New York, 1863, a chapter is devoted to uræmic intoxication,
or the exhilaration produced by the entrance into the blood of urine,
either injected or abnormally absorbed. This part of the subject
should be carefully scrutinized by medical experts, whose determinations
may make known whether or not the drunken frenzy of the Zuñi
dancers could be attributed to the unnatural beverage exclusively or
to that in combination with other intoxicants.</p>

<p>Dunglison says: “Human urine was at one time considered aperient;
and was given in jaundice in the dose of one or two ounces.
Cow’s urine, urina vaccæ, all-flower water, was once used, warm from
the cow, as a purge.”—(“Dunglison’s Medical Dictionary,” Philadelphia,
Pa., 1860, article “Urine.”)</p>

<p>In the “Lancet,” October, 1880, p. 56, Mr. G. F. Masterman draws
attention to the chemical analysis of beef tea, and shows that it is
analogous to urine, excepting that it contains less urea and uric acid.
“Many writers have endeavored to impress the public and the profession
with the true value of beef tea, viz., that it is not a nutrient but
a stimulant, and that it mainly contains excrementitious materials.”—(“Beef
Tea, Liebig’s Extract, Extractum Carnis, and Urine,” Richard
Neale, M. D., in the “Practitioner,” London, November, 1881, p. 343
<i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>“In South America urine is a common vehicle for medicine, and
the urine of little boys is spoken highly of as a stimulant in malignant
small-pox. Among the Chinese and Malays of Batavia urine is very
freely used. One of the worst cases of epistaxis ceased after a pint of
fresh urine was drunk, although it had for thirty-six hours or more
resisted every form of European medicine. This was by no means an
unusual result of the use of urine, as I was informed by many of the
natives.... As a stimulant and general pick-up, I have frequently
seen a glass of child’s or a young girl’s urine tossed off with great gusto
and apparent benefit. The use of urate of ammonia and guano was
noticed by Bauer in 1852, who found their external use of value in
phthisis, lepra, morphoæ, and other obstinate skin diseases. Dr.
Hasting’s report of the value of the excreta of reptiles in 1862, in
the treatment of phthisis, will also be fresh in the recollection of the
older members of the profession.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Some of the tribes of Central Africa use human urine as an invigorant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
during the fever season, much as Europeans employ quinine.—(Rev.
Mr. Chatelain, missionary in Angola, Africa.)</p>

<p>“The people of Angola apply fresh urine to all cuts and bruises.”—(“Muhongo,”
African boy from Angola, West Africa, in personal interview
with Captain Bourke, translated by Rev. Mr. Chatelain, missionary.)</p>

<h3>ORDURE AND URINE IN FOLK-MEDICINE.</h3>

<p>Excrementitious remedies are still to be met with in the folk-medicine
of various countries; indeed, the problem would be to determine
in what country of the world at the present day the more ignorant
classes do not still use them. The extracts to be now given will show
that folk-medicine still retains a hold upon medicaments the use of
which is generally believed to have passed away with the centuries.</p>

<p>“I never had an opportunity of seeing the following deed, but it was
many times asserted to me by serious persons: In our province, Brittany,
when somebody in the peasantry has a cheek swollen by the
effects of toothache, a very good remedy is to apply upon the swollen
cheek, as a poultice, freshly expelled cow-dung, and even human dung,
just expelled and still smoking, which is considered as much more efficient.”—(Personal
letter from Captain Henri Jouan, French Navy,
Cherbourg, France, July 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>Among the many quaint recipes preserved in the Materia Medica of
English physicians down almost to our own day we find that pigeon’s
dung was used “to make a cataplasm against scrophulous and other
like hard tumors; ... for an ointment against baldness; ... for a
cataplasm to ripen a plague sore; ... to make a powder against the
stone.”—(John Mathews Eaton, “Treatise on Breeding Pigeons,”

Republic of Colombia, South America, states that among the San
Blas Indians of that country, and the lower classes generally, the
patient’s own urine is applied warm for sore eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, of Cambridge, Mass., has for some years devoted
time and intelligent study to the acquisition of data bearing upon
the superstitions connected with the human saliva. While making this
valuable and curious collection she has also been fortunate enough to
encounter much relating to kindred superstitions, and has very generously
placed at the disposal of the author of this volume all that
related to the employment of human and animal egestæ.</p>

<p>Urine a cure for chapped hands, on Deer Isle.</p>

<p>Urinate into your shoe to keep it from squeaking, on Deer Isle.</p>

<p>Sheep-dung tea, a cure for measles, is extensively used on Deer
Isle.</p>

<p>Boys urinate on their legs to prevent cramp. This practice was
common in eastern Maine twenty to thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Water standing in the depressions of cow-dung was formerly recommended
as a certain cure for pulmonary consumption, in New York.</p>

<p>Oil tried from the penis of the hog and applied to the loins of a child
suffering from weakness of kidneys or bladder cured such diseases, in
northern parts of the United States and in parts of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>One’s own urine was administered for gravel in Staffordshire, England,
within the past ten years.</p>

<p>A woman in England was given her own urine to drink, after a severe
illness, to prevent “fits,” in the present generation. A poultice of
fresh, warm cow-dung cured a man of rheumatism in New York.
Measles were cured by giving the patient a decoction of lamb’s excrements
(locally called “nanny-beads”), in Brunswick, N. Y., about
1825. A newly born child was given a spoonful of woman’s urine as
a laxative, in 1814, in St. Albans, Vt. The white, limy part of hen-manure
was used for canker-sores in mouth, in Abingdon, Ill. Cow-manure
was used for swelled breasts in County Cork, Ireland. Sheep-manure
tea was used for measles in County Cork, Ireland, and by the
negroes of Chestertown, Md. Sheep-dung tea for measles all over New
England, Ohio, and Cape Breton. Cow-dung, as fresh as possible,
plastered on inflamed breasts, commonly known as “bealed” breasts,
within the last twenty-five years, on Cape Breton.</p>

<p>Similar excrementitious remedies are in use among the Pennsylvania
Germans. Cow-dung poultices are applied in the treatment of diphtheria,
or as lenitives in cases of sore or gathered breasts. “Tea made
of sheep-cherries (Gen. et spec.?) is given for measles.”—(“Folk-Medicine
of the Pennsylvania Germans,” in “Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc.,”
1889.)</p>

<p>For reasons not ascertained, the use of these revolting medicaments
has nearly always been veiled under the language of euphemism.
Sheep-dung is rarely called by its own name, but always, as has been
shown in the preceding remarks, “sheep-nanny tea,” etc. In the same
manner, the use of human excreta was veiled under the high-sounding
designations of “zibethum,” “oriental sulphur,” etc.</p>

<p>This use of sheep-dung in the treatment of measles must be very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
ancient and wide-spread. Surgeon Washington Matthews notes its
existence among the Navajoes, who learned it from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>“Slight wounds are cured” by the application of dirt to the part
affected.—(“Nat. trib. of S. Australia,” p. 284, received through the
kindness of the Roy. Soc. Sydney, N. S. Wales, T. B. Kyngdon,
Secretary.)</p>

<p>Mr. Chrisfield, of the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C., states
that urine was a remedy for earache among people on eastern shore of
Maryland and Virginia; while for the cure of jaundice, in New England,
“the spider, and even a more disagreeable remedy, is administered
in a spoonful of molasses.”—(“Folk-Medicine,” Black, London,
1883, p. 61, quoting Napier, “Folk-Lore,” p. 95, and “Folk-Lore
Record,” vol. i. p. 45.)</p>

<p>“I am impressed to tell you of a custom that prevailed to some extent
among the people of this State (Iowa); this was the use of sheep-dung
for measles. The dung was made into what the old women
denominated ‘tea,’ and was familiarly known as ‘sheep-nanny tea.’
It was believed to be singularly efficacious in bringing out the eruption.
The mixture was sweetened with sugar, and thus disguised was
given to children. This practice was kept up among certain classes
until about twenty years ago; I have not heard of it, at least in recent
years. I can trace the custom through the origin of the families in
which it was practised here to Indiana and North Carolina.”—(Personal
letter from Prof. S. B. Evans, Ottumwa, Iowa, to Captain Bourke,
April 16, 1888.)</p>

<p>“I was told by an old person, now dead, that some fifty years since
the urine of a cow was given internally as a remedy for chlorosis, in
the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.”—(Personal letter from Prof.
Frank Rede Fowke to Captain Bourke, dated London, England, June
18, 1888.)</p>

<p>“In the country where I was born I have seen several times, when
a cow or an ox had one of its horns knocked away by a shock or any
other cause, people pissing into the horn before putting it again over
its root. This was supposed necessary to cause the horn to stick firmly
against the root.”—(Personal letter from Captain Henri Jouan, French
Navy, Cherbourg, July 29, 1888.)</p>

<p>“The presence of ammonia in the secretions (whose power of neutralizing
acids may have been accidentally discovered) may have had
something to do with the repute of the excretions of the kidneys. I
remember to have been told as a little boy of the virtues of urine as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
relief to chapped hands, also as a counter-irritant for inflamed eyes.
In the former case the ammonia would soften as an alkali; in the latter,
the salts present would act to reduce congestion, like common salt,
by endosmosis.”—(Personal letter from Prof. E. N. Horsford, Harvard
University, to Captain Bourke, April 19, 1888.)</p>

<p>“I have been recently informed, by a man who is acquainted with
the peculiarities of Parisian life, that there are men who are in the
habit of swallowing the scum which they obtain from the street urinals,
and that they are known as ‘Les mangeurs du blanc.’” (Prof. Frank
Rede Fowke.) According to Parent du Chatelet, a “mangeur du
blanc” meant in Paris, until 1810, “a man who lived off the earnings
of a strumpet.” The name has since been changed to “paillasson.”
(See “La Prostitution,” Paris, 1857, vol. i. p. 138.)</p>

<p>“When I was a boy we had in my father’s house a gang of cats,
and I remember that frequently the people of Cherbourg came and
asked permission to search in our garrets for cat’s dung, which,
they said, mixed and infused in white wine, produced a very efficient
drink against periodical fits of fever.”—(Captain Henri Jouan, French
Navy.)</p>

<p>“Lye-tea, made of human urine and lime-water, was used for colds by
the ‘old people’ in the rural parts of Central New York.”—(Conversation
with Colonel Pierce, Dr. Pangborn, and Lieutenant W. G.
Elliott, U. S. Army, at San Carlos Agency, Arizona.)</p>

<p>The savages of Australia apply to wounds the resin of the eucalyptus,
and also the bark of the same tree, previously steeped in human
urine. (Personal letter from John Mathew, Esq., M. A., to Captain
Bourke, dated “The Manse,” Coburg, Victoria, November, 1889.)
The same thing is referred to in “The Australian Race,” E. M. Curr,
Melbourne, 1886, vol. i. p. 256. In regard to the uses of the crust of
latrines, in connection with “mangeurs du blanc,” see other pages of
this volume.</p>

<p>“Philos.; hermet.; urine du vin, le vinaigre. Urine des jeunes
colériques Le Mercure Philosophe.” Dict. National, par M. Bescherelle,
aîné, Paris, 1857, sub voc. Urine (p. 1573).</p>

<p>We have already been informed from Marco Polo that the prisoners
taken by the Tartars often poisoned themselves; “for which reason
the great lords haue dogs’ dung ready, which they force them to swallow,
and that forceth them to vomit the poyson” (in Purchas, vol. i.
p. 92); and we have also learned, from many sources,—Etmuller,
Schurig, Levinus Lemnius, Flemming, Paullini, Beckherius,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
Lentilius,—of the antidotal powers of the excreta. The existence of the
very same belief was detected among the natives of America.</p>

<p>Padre Inamma, whose interesting researches upon rattlesnake bites
and their remedies (made in Lower California, some time before the
expulsion of the Jesuits, in 1767) are published in Clavigero,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> says
that the most usual and most efficacious antidote was human ordure,
fresh and dissolved in water, drunk by the person bitten.</p>

<p>Along the Isthmus of Darien the belief was prevalent among the
aborigines that the most efficacious remedy for poisoned arrows was
that which required the wounded man to swallow pills of his own
excrement.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>So in Peru, “when sucking infants were taken ill, especially if their
ailment was of a feverish nature, they washed them in urine in the
mornings, and when they could get some of the urine of the child,
they gave it a drink.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h3>OCCULT INFLUENCES ASCRIBED TO ORDURE AND URINE.</h3>

<p>In Canada, human urine was drunk as a medicine. Father Sagard
witnessed a dance of the Hurons in which the young men, women,
and girls danced naked around a sick woman, into whose mouth one
of the young men urinated, she swallowing the disgusting draught in
the hope of being cured.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Analogous medicaments may be hinted at in Smith’s account of the
Araucanians of Chili: “Their remedies are principally if not entirely,
vegetable matter, though they administer many disgusting compounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
of animal matter, which they pretend are endowed with miraculous
powers.”—(Smith, “Araucanians,” New York, 1855, p. 234.)</p>

<p>Brand enumerates obsolete recipes, one of which (disease not mentioned)
directed the patient to take “five spoonfuls of knave child
urine of an innocent.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” London, 1849, vol. iii.
p. 282.)</p>

<p>The Crees apply the dung of animals lately killed to sprains.—(See
“Mackenzie’s Voyages,” etc., to the Arctic Circle, London, 1800,
introd. p. 106.)</p>

<p>Henry M. Stanley says that, for the cure of certain ulcers due to
fly-blow, from which his men suffered, “Safeni, my coxswain on the
Victoria Nyanza, ... adopted a very singular treatment, which I
must confess was also wonderfully successful.... This medicine consisted
of a powder of copper and child’s urine, painted over the wound
with a feather twice a day.”—(“Through the Dark Continent,” New
York, 1878, vol. ii. p. 369.)</p>

<p>“It appeared that the dung of the donkey, rubbed on the skin, was
supposed to be a cure for rheumatism, and that this rare specific was
brought from a distant country in the East, where such animals exist.”—(“The
Albert Nyanza,” Sir Samuel Baker, Philadelphia, 1869,
p. 372.)</p>

<p>“The Mandingoes of Africa dress abscesses with cow’s dung.”—(See
Mungo Park’s “Travels in Africa,” in Pinkerton, vol. xvii. p. 877.
See, also, the edition of his works, “Travels in Africa,” New York, etc.)</p>

<p>The author has seen cow-manure plastered with soothing effect upon
bee-stings in New Jersey.</p>

<p>“Pro remedio, in pluribus morbis urina fœminæ externe applicata,
in eximia estimatione habetur.”—(“The Native Tribes of South
Australia,” Adelaide, 1879, introduction, xvi. See, also, Eyre, “Expedition
into Central Australia,” London, 1845, ii. 300.)</p>

<p>“Pilgrim’s Salve. A Sir-Reverence; human excrement.”—(Grose,
“Dictionary of Buckish Slang,” London, 1811.)</p>

<p>“The medicine-men of the Ove-herero, who live south of Angola
(which is on the west coast of Africa), urinate over the sick, in order to
cure them.”—(“Muhongo,” interpretation by Rev. Mr. Chatelain.)</p>

<p>The Inuit medicine-man asperses the sick with human urine, “le
goupillonne avec de vieilles urines, à l’instar des docteurs à poison
bochimans ... les Cambodgiens aspergent également le démon de
la petite-vérole avec de l’urine, mais cette urine est celle d’un cheval
blanc.”—(Réclus, “Les Primitifs,” p. 98.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>“There are few complaints that the natives do not attempt to cure,
either by charms or by specific applications. Of the latter, a very
singular one is the application personally of the urine from a female,—a
very general remedy, and considered a sovereign one for most disorders.”—(Eyre,
“Expedition into Central Australia,” London, 1845,
vol. ii. p. 300; contributed by Prof. H. C. Henshaw, Bureau of Ethnology,
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.)</p>

<p>(See previous references to the therapeutics of the native Australians
in this volume.)</p>

<p>“Plasters of mixed grass, butter, and cow-dung were placed on the
wounds” of sore-backed animals in Abyssinia.—(“A Visit to Abyssinia,”
W. Winstanley, London, 1881, vol. ii. p. 3.)</p>

<p>Cameron employed a native medicine-man, near Lake Tanganyika,
to treat one of his men who had injured his eye. “His treatment
consisted of a plaster of mud and dirt, and his fee was forty strings of
beads.”—(“Across Africa,” London, 1877, vol. i. p. 322. The word
“dirt,” as used by Cameron in the above sentence, no doubt means
ordure.)</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart Culin, of Philadelphia, Penn., who has been making
careful investigations into the Chinese materia medica, states that
“frequent directions for the use of urine” are to be seen “among the
official remedies in the herbal.” Only a few pages back, reference was
had to the use by the Chinese in Batavia of all kinds of excrementitious
remedies.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The Reverend Maurice J. Bywater writes from Nassau, Bahamas,
that during the seven years he was on missionary duty in the island
of Borneo, he witnessed several very curious and remarkable instances
of the restorative and stimulating effects of human urine, as used by
the Chinese immigrants in cases of accident.</p>

<p>The Coreans use the same system of medicine as the Chinese. Both
employ plasters of human excrement for bites, erysipelas, inflammations,
etc. They use the urine of a healthy boy as a tonic.—(Dr. H.
T. Allen, Secretary of Legation, Corean Embassy, Washington, D. C.,
1888.)<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Our knowledge of the Thibetans is still so limited that we must not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
attach too much importance to the little we have so far gained; there
is still much to be learned concerning that singular, isolated race.</p>

<p>The strange veneration accorded the excrement of the Grand Lama
has been fully discussed, but their sacred books do not show that the
employment of stercoraceous medicaments is carried any farther.</p>

<p>According to the translation of the “Pratimoksha Sutra” made by
Mr. W. W. Rockhill, sick Buddhist monks were ordered to employ the
following remedies: “Le beurre fondu, l’huile, la mélasse, le miel,
l’écume de mélasse.”—(“Asiatic Society,” Paris, 1885, p. 22.)</p>

<p>Dr. Francis Parkman, in his “Jesuits in North America,” Boston,
1867, introduction, p. xl., speaks of the “revolting remedies” employed
by the Huron, Iroquois, and Algonquin tribes.</p>

<p>The following are among many of the curious recipes given in the
“Tragedy of the Gout,” written by Blambeauseant, in 1600:—</p>

<p>“Ther’s the odorous sheep’s dung, given always on the sly.”</p>

<p>“A little blue ointment, mixed with man’s ordure.”</p>

<p>“Virgin’s urine, as a cure for all the men in town.”</p>

<p>(“Medicine in the Middle Ages,” Minor, p. 88.)</p>

<p>Further references can be found in the following list, taken from
the “Bibliotheca Scatalogica,” which likewise contains several of those
from which citations have already been made.</p>

<p>“Cet emploi des stercora, et en particulier, de ceux de l’homme,
pour les usages pharmaceutiques, est très réel. On nommait médecins
stercoraires ceux qui les prescrivaient, et on dissimulait l’origine de la
substance sous diverses dénominations bizarres ou ridicules (carbon
humanum, oletum, sulphur occidentale). Suivant Paracelse, les excréments
humains pouvaient par une certaine préparation, acquérir

Assafœt.) On the principle of “lucus a non lucendo,” the works of
Swieten, “Commentariorum,” etc., Lyons, 1776, are worthy of special
mention; careful examination fails to discover any allusion to the use
of excreta, human or animal, in pharmacy or therapeutics, and no
mention is made of witchcraft. Therefore the works of this author
mark a new stage in the development of scientific and religious
thought.</p>

<p>In Warner’s “Topographical Remarks relating to the southwestern
parts of Hampshire,” 1793 (vol. ii. p. 131), speaking of the old register
of Christ Church, that author tells us, “The same register affords,
also, several very curious receipts, or modes of cure in some singular
cases of indisposition; they are, apparently, of the beginning of the
seventeenth century, and couched in the uncouth phraseology of that
time.” I forbear, however, to insert them, from motives of delicacy.—(Brand,
“Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 306, article “Physical Charms.”)</p>

<p>“A new-born babe was not considered fully prepared for life’s journey
until its stomach had been filled and emptied by a potation of
molasses diluted with the vesical secretions of the first youngster that
could be secured for the purpose.”—(“Professional Reminiscences,”
Benjamin Eddy Cutting, M. D., Curator of the Lowell Institute, Boston,
Mass., 1888, p. 40.)</p>

<h3>OTHER EXCREMENTITIOUS REMEDIES.</h3>

<p>It was not enough that the urine and ordure of men and animals
should be employed in pharmacy; everything that could be taken from
the bodies of men or animals, wild or domesticated, living or dead, was
enlisted to swell the dread list of filth remedies.</p>

<p>Etmuller supplies the following list of remedies; “sumuntur ex corpore
vivente:” Hair, nails, saliva, ear-wax, sweat, milk, menses, after-birth,
urine, ordure, semen, blood, calculi, worms, lice, caul (of infant),
... and these “ex partibus corporis demortui.” ... The whole
corpse, flesh, skin, fat, bones, skull, moss growing on a skull, brain,
gall, heart. Gall of animals has been used by the Indians of North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
America as a stimulant. (See Etmuller, Michaelus, “Opera Omnia,”
vol. ii. p. 265, Schrod. “Dil. Zoöl.”)</p>

<p>He also recites that the following parts of domestic kine were used
in medical practice: horns, bile, liver, spleen, blood, marrow, tallow,
fat, hoofs, urine, ordure, testicles, milk, butter, cheese, phallus, and
bones.—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 248 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<h3>HAIR.</h3>

<p>“The first hair cut from an infant’s head will modify the attacks of
gout.... The hair of a man torn down from the cross is good for
quartan fevers.”—(Pliny, lib. xxviii. cap. 7.)</p>

<p>“The smell of a woman’s hair, burnt, will drive away serpents, and
hysterical suffocations, it is said, may be dispelled thereby. The ashes
of a woman’s hair, burnt in an earthen vessel, will cure eruptions and
porrigo of the eyes ... warts and ulcers upon infants ... wounds
upon the head ... corrosive ulcers ... inflammatory tumors and
gout ... erysipelas and hemorrhages, and itching pimples.”—(Pliny,
lib. xxviii. c. 20.)</p>

<p>Schurig commends the use of human hair in cases of baldness, applied
externally in salve, chopped fine or in ashes; for the cure of
yellow jaundice, it was powdered and drunk in some suitable menstruum;
it was employed in luxation of the joints, for hemorrhage from
wounds: “Ad canis morsuum, infantis capilli cum aceto impositu
morsum sine tumore sanant et capitis ulcera emendant.”—(Sextus
Placitus, art. “De Puello et Puella Virgine.”)</p>

<p>Flemming advised that it be powdered and drunk in wine as a cure
for yellow jaundice; woman’s hair, powdered and made into a salve,
with lard, was of general efficacy; men’s hair was burned under the
nostrils of those suffering from lethargy; and was drunk for “suffocation
of the womb.”—(“De Remediis,” etc. p. 8.)</p>

<p>A medicinal oil was distilled from the hair of a full beard, and an
ointment made from the same. Powdered human hair was drunk as a
potion in a cure for yellow jaundice; the ashes of burnt hair were made
into an unguent with mutton tallow, and applied to the nostrils of people
in a state of lethargy; in “suffocation of the uterus,” this ointment
was applied to the pudenda. The hair of a patient was frequently
used in affecting “sympathetic cures,” or in what were called “Cures
by Transplantation,” but the names of the diseases are not given by
Flemming (p. 21). (But see under “Cures by Transplantation” in
this volume.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span></p>

<p>In China, the shavings of the hair, which must amount to a considerable
quantity, since hundreds of millions of people shave the head
close daily, are preserved for manuring the land.—(See “Bingham’s
Exped. to China,” London, 1842, vol. ii. p. 7.)</p>

<p>In China, everything connected with the tilling of the fields is still
a religious rite. Probably no country in the world of equal advancement
has adhered with more tenacity to old usages in all that pertains to the
turning-up of the soil; there are ceremonies in which the Emperor
himself must lead with a plough. How much all this may have to do
with the utilization of a refuse which has been so generally regarded as
possessed of “magical” or “medicinal” properties, is, in all likelihood,
never to be ascertained; but attention should be attracted to the fact,
in the same manner that it was found worth while to make an examination
into the history of latrines.</p>

<p>“Among ourselves, it is a Devonshire belief that you can give a
neighbor ague by burying a dead man’s hair under his threshold.”—(“Folk-Medicine,”
Black, p. 27.)</p>

<p>“In Devonshire and in Scotland alike, when a child has whooping-cough,
a hair is taken from its head, put between slices of bread and
butter, and given to a dog, and if in eating it the dog cough, as naturally
he will, the whooping-cough will be transferred to the animal, and
the child will go free.” The same method of cure is practised in Ireland,
but the animal selected is an ass.—(Idem, p. 35.)</p>

<p>“Certain oak-trees at Berkhampstead, in Hertfordshire, were long
famous for the cure of ague. The transference was simple, but painful.
A lock of hair was pegged into an oak, and then, by a sudden
wrench, transferred from the head of the patient to the tree.”—(Idem,
p. 39.)</p>

<p>Clippings of hair and rags are offered to holy wells in Ireland, Borneo,
Malabar, etc., not merely as offerings to deities, but in order to
effect a “transference” of diseases to the people who may take hold
of them.—(Idem, pp. 39, 40; quoting from Tylor, “Primitive Culture,”
vol. ii., and others.)</p>

<p>“In New England, to cure a child of the rickets, a lock of its hair
is buried at cross-roads, and if at full moon, so much the better.”—(Idem,
p. 56.)</p>

<p>It is believed in parts of England that the hairs from a donkey’s back,
wrapped up in bread, and given to a sick child, will cure the whooping-cough;
another remedy of the same kind is to take clippings from the
child’s own head, mix them in butter, and give to a dog, which will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
take the disease from the child; still another was to mount the sufferer
upon the back of an ass, and lead him nine times round an oak-tree.—(See
Brand, “Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 288, art. “Physical
Charms.”)</p>

<p>The Romans attached certain omens to the manner, time, and place
of cutting the nails and hair.—(See Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 5.)</p>

<p>The ancients believed that “no person in a ship must pare his nails,
or cut his hair except in a storm.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” vol. iii. p. 239,
art. “Omens Among Sailors,” quoting Petronius Arbiter.)</p>

<p>“When a man has his hair cut, he is careful to burn it, or bury it
secretly, lest falling into the hands of some one who has an evil eye,
or is a witch, it should be used as a charm to afflict him with a headache.”—(Livingston,
“Zambesi,” London, 1865, p. 47.)</p>

<p>Etmuller relates that in his time women suffering from retention of
the menses were in the habit of plucking the hair growing on the pubis,
which would promptly cause their reappearance, but whether by the
irritation or by taking the hair internally, is not clear:—“Mulieres
suffocatæ ex utero soleant vellicare in pilis pubis, ut citius et felicius
ad se redeant.” Finger-nail clippings were drunk as an emetic, especially
by soldiers while on campaign:—“Ungues infusi in vinum
vel potum cum vehementia cient vomitum et purgant per fecessum
... propinavit pro vomitorio et purgante militibus ungues proprios
infusos per noctem in vinum calidum.”—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 269.)</p>

<p>“The hair and nails are cut at the full moon.”—(Grimm, “Teutonic
Mythology,” Stallybrass, London, 1882, vol. ii, p. 712 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The Patagonians “all believe that the witches and wizards can injure
whom they choose, even to deprivation of life, if they can possess themselves
of some part of their intended victim’s body, or that which has
proceeded thence, such as hair, pieces of nails, etc.... And this
superstition is the more curious from its exact accordance with that
so prevalent in Polynesia.”—(“Voyage of the Adventure and Beagle,”
London, 1839, vol. ii. p. 163, quoting the Jesuit Faulkner.)</p>

<p>“Which is the most deadly deed whereby a man increases most
the baleful strength of the Dævas, as he would by offering them a
sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“Ahura Mazda answered:—‘It is when a man here below combing
his hair or shaving it off, or paring off his nails, drops them in a hole
or in a crack.’”—(Fargard XVII. Avendidad, Zendavesta, Oxford,
1880, p. 186.)</p>

<p>Beckherius states that the clippings of the finger-nails made an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
emetic. “Vomitorium non inelegans ex iis paratur.”—(“Med.
Mic.”)</p>

<p>Flemming goes more into detail; he says that the finely ground
clippings of the hoof of the elk, stag, goat, hull, etc., were employed
as a vomitory, but in their absence, human finger-nails were substituted;
“istam ungulorum speciem quæ ab homine desumitur, substitui.” Human
finger-nail clippings were also recommended in “sympathetic”
cures.—(Flemming, “De Remediis,” p. 21.)</p>

<p>“He who trims his nails and buries the parings is a pious man; he
who burns them is a righteous man; but he who throws them away
is a wicked man, for mischance might follow should a female step over
them.”—(Paul Isaac Hershon, “Talmudic Miscellany,” Boston, 1880,
p. 49; footnote to above, “The orthodox Jews in Poland are to this day
careful to bury away or burn their nail-parings.”)</p>

<p>On a fragment of a Chaldean tablet occurs this curious passage:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“A son to his mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(if) he has said to her, Thou art not my mother</div>

<p>In the province of Moray, Scotland, “In hectic fevers and consumptive
diseases they pare the nails of the fingers and toes of the patient,
put these in a bag made of a rag from his clothes, ... then wave
their hand with the rag thrice round his head, crying ‘Deas Soil,’ after
which they bury the rag in some unknown place.” Pliny, in his
Natural History, mentions it as practised by the magicians or Druids
of his time.—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” vol. iii. p. 286, art. “Physical
Charms.”)</p>

<h3>SUPERSTITIONS CONNECTED WITH THE HUMAN SALIVA.</h3>

<p>The most recent work on this subject is the extended monograph of
Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, now in press,
and to the pages of which the author of this volume has contributed
his own collection of data.</p>

<p>Reference may also be had, with advantage, to Brand’s Popular
Antiquities, Reginald Scot’s “Discoverie of Witchcraft,” Black’s “Folk-Medicine,”
Samuel Augustus Flemming’s “De Remediis ex Corpore
Humano desumtis,” Lenormant’s “La Magie chez les Chaldéens,” and
to the works of Pliny, Galen, “Saxon Leechdoms,” Levinus Lemnius,
Beckherius, Etmuller, and many others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p>John Graham Dalyell, “Superstitions of Scotland,” Edinburgh, 1834,
has a chapter on the occult influences attributed to human saliva.
When the Khonds of Orissa were about to sacrifice a human victim,
they were wont to solicit the favor of having him spit in their faces;
“sollicitent un crachat qu’ils s’étendront soigneusement.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” Réclus, p. 368.)</p>

<p>In the ritual of the Hill Tribes of the Nilgherris, it is related:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mada a craché dans les fontaines.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Quoted in “Les Primitifs,” p. 244.)</p>

<p>Frommann, in his “Tractatus de Fascinatione,” Nuremburg, 1675,
speaks of the anointing of eyes with saliva, to cure blindness; this he
compares to the use made by our Saviour of the same (p. 196).</p>

<p>“The Kirghis tribes apply to their sorcerers, or Baksy, to chase
away demons, and thus to cure the diseases they are supposed to produce.
To this end they whip the invalid until the blood comes, and
then spit in his face.”—(“Chaldean Magic,” François Lenormant,
London, 1873, p. 212.)</p>

<p>Many interesting practices connected with the human saliva, are
given in Lady Wilde’s “Ancient Legends and Superstitions of Ireland,”
Boston, 1888. See also “The Golden Bough,” James G. Frazer, M.A.,
London, 1890, vol. i. pp. 385, 386.</p>

<h3>CERUMEN OR EAR-WAX.</h3>

<p>Pliny speaks of its use in medicine (lib. xxviii. cap. 7); Galen does
also. Flemming recommended its internal use in colic and cramps;
and externally as an application to wounds.—(“De Remediis,” etc.,
p. 22.)</p>

<p>Paullini was of the opinion that a good salve for sore eyes could be
prepared from cerumen (pp. 42, 43).</p>

<p>“The excrement of the ears, like unto a yellow oyntment, is a great
comfort in the pricking of the sinews.”—(Von Helmont, “Oritrika,”
English translation, London, 1662, p. 247.)</p>

<p>Galen thought that ear-wax was efficacious in the cure of whit-nails;
the other “sordes” were also employed, but he would not write about
them, on account of the difficulty of obtaining them,—such as the
perspiration flowing in the bath, or scraped from the body after severe
exercise; and, finally, the fatty matter of wool was of medicinal value,
and seemed to have the same properties as butter.—(Galen, “Opera
Omnia,” lib. xii. p. 309, Kuhn’s edition, Leipzig, 1829.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<h3>WOMAN’S MILK.</h3>

<p>Woman’s milk mitigated redness of eyes and inflammation of the
lachrymal glands; it should be used with vitriol. For “gutta serena”
it was applied as an ointment; in cases of atrophy it was regarded by
many as of commendable utility, especially if drawn from the woman’s
breast; the same treatment was a specific in obstinate hiccough.</p>

<p>A butter prepared from woman’s milk was used in diseases of children,
especially colic, and in ocular affections. (See Flemming, “De
Remediis,” etc., p. 18.) Its remedial efficacy forms the basis of Pliny’s
c. 21, lib. xxviii.; if possible, it should be that of a woman who had just
borne male twins. “If a person is rubbed at the same time with the
milk of both mother and daughter, he will be proof for all the rest of
his life against all affections of the eyes.... Mixed with the urine of
a youth who has not yet arrived at puberty, it removes ringing in the
ears.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“Matricis vulneribus confert ... lac mulieris.”—(Avicenna, vol. i.
p. 337, a 36.)</p>

<p>The Empress of China took the milk of sixty wet nurses to keep
herself alive, according to Mr. Frank G. Carpenter.</p>

<p>Woman’s milk is still used in the rude trephining of the African
Kabyles as a dressing.—(See “Prehistoric Trephining,” by Dr. Robert
Fletcher, in vol. v. “Contributions to North American Ethnology,”
Washington, D. C., 1882.)</p>

<h3>HUMAN SWEAT.</h3>

<p>Human perspiration was believed to be valuable not only as a means
of prognosis in some diseases, but its appearance was dreaded in others.
If the perspiration of a fever-stricken patient was mixed with dough,
baked into bread, and given to a dog, the dog would catch the fever,
and the man recover. It was efficacious in driving away scrofulous
wens, and in rendering philters abortive. It was narrated that if a man,
who under the influence of a philter, was forced to love a girl against
his will, would put on a pair of new shoes, and wear them out by walking
in them, and then drink wine out of the right shoe, where it could
mingle with the perspiration already there, he would promptly be cured
of his love, and hate take its place.</p>

<p>This corresponds closely to the urine case already noted; and it is
proper to repeat Flemming’s own words on the matter: “Narrant
quod, si quis philtro fascinatus era fuerit, ad amandam præter voluntatem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
virginem, ut is noves induat calces, miliareque unum obambulando
conficiat, quo sudor animadvertatur postque vinum e calceo dextri
pedis sudore madido, hauriat, sic ab illicito amore liberari amoremque
in odium converti dicunt.”—(“De Remediis,” p. 19.)</p>

<p>See Etmuller, who used it in scrofula, lib. ii. p. 265; Pliny, lib. 28;
Galen and Avicenna (sweat of gladiators), vol. i. p. 398, a 17, and
elsewhere.</p>

<h3>SUPERSTITIONS CONNECTED WITH THE CATAMENIAL FLUID.</h3>

<p>For the opinions entertained by the ancients regarding its occult
powers, read Pliny (Bohn’s edition), lib. xxviii. cap. 23, and again lib.
viii. cap. 13. “On the approach of a woman in this state, must will
become sour, seeds which are touched by her become sterile, grafts
wither away, garden-plants are parched up, and the fruit will fall from
the tree beneath which she sits; ... a swarm of bees if looked upon
by her will die immediately, brass and iron will immediately become
rusty.... Dogs tasting the catamenial fluid will go mad.... In addition
to this, the bitumen which is found at certain periods of the year
floating on the Lake of Judea, known as Asphaltites,—a substance which
is peculiarly tenacious, and adheres to everything it touches,—can only
be divided into separate pieces by a thread which has been dipped into
this virulent matter.” (Lib. vii. cap. 13, and again lib. xxviii. cap. 23.)
In a footnote it is stated that both Josephus (“Bell. Jud.,” lib. iv. cap. 9)
and Tacitus (lib. v. cap. 6) give an account of this supposed action of this
fluid on the bitumen of Lake Asphaltites. “Hail-storms, they say, whirl-winds,
and lightning even, will be scared away by a woman uncovering
her body merely, even though menstruating at the time.” (Lib. xxviii.
cap. 23.) Menstruating women, in Cappadocia, perambulated the fields
of grain to preserve them from worms and caterpillars. (Idem.)
“Young vines, too, it is said, are injured irremediably by the touch of
a woman in this state; and both rue and ivy plants, possessed of highly
medicinal virtues, will die instantly upon being touched by her....
The edge of a razor will become blunted on coming in contact with
her.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“All plants will turn pale upon the approach of a woman who has
the menstrual discharge upon her.” (Pliny, lib. xix. cap. 57.) The same
opinion prevailed in France down to our own times. (Idem, footnote.)</p>

<p>“Expiations were made with the menstrual discharge, ... not only
by midwives, but even by harlots as well” (lib. xxviii. cap. 20).</p>

<p>Frommann cites Aristotle and Pliny in reference to the maleficent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
effects of the menses and of the uncanniness of a menstruating woman.
Aristotle said her glance took the polish out of a mirror, and the next
person looking into it would be bewitched. Frommann quotes a man
who said he saw a tree in Goa which had withered because a catamenial
napkin had been hung in it.—(“Tractatus de Fascinatione,”
Nuremburg, 1675, pp. 17, 18.)</p>

<p>“Stains upon a garment made with the catamenial fluid can only be
removed by the agency of the urine of the same female.”—(Pliny,
lib. xxviii. cap. 24.)</p>

<p>“An Australian black fellow who discovered that his wife had lain
on his blanket at her menstrual period, killed her, and died of terror
himself within a fortnight. Hence Australian women at these times
are forbidden under pain of death to touch anything that men use.”
(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 170. He supplies other examples
from the Eskimo and the Indians of North America. “Tinneh,”
etc., p. 170.) In the following example we are not certain that the
young women selected were undergoing purgation, but there is some
reason for believing that such was the case, especially in view of the
general dissemination of the ideas connected with the catamenia.
“In a district of Transylvania, when the ground is parched with
drought, some girls strip themselves naked, and, led by an older
woman, who is also naked, they steal a harrow and carry it across the
field to a brook, where they set it afloat. Next they sit on the harrow,
and keep a tiny flame burning on each corner of it for an hour;
then they leave the harrow and go home. A similar rain-charm is
resorted to in India; naked women drag a plough across the field by
night.”—(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 17.)</p>

<p>For all bites of centipedes the people of Angola, Portuguese and
negroes, apply the catamenial fluid. This remedy is implicitly believed
in by all concerned.—(Rev. Mr. Chatelain, missionary to Angola,
Africa.)</p>

<p>For the Inuit, see “Les Primitifs,” Réclus, Paris, 1885.</p>

<p>The dread felt by the American Indians on this subject is too well
known to need much attention in these pages; it corresponds in every
respect to the particulars recited by Pliny. Squaws, at the time of
menstrual purgation, are obliged to seclude themselves; in most tribes
they are compelled to occupy isolated lodges; and in all are forbidden
to prepare food for any one but themselves.</p>

<p>It is believed that were a menstruating woman to step astride of a
rifle or a bow or a lance, the weapon would have no further utility.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
Medicine-men are in the habit of making a saving clause, whenever they
proceed to make “medicine;” this is to the effect that the “medicine”
will be all right provided no woman in this peculiar condition
be allowed to approach the tent or lodge of the officiating charlatan.</p>

<p>Among the Navajoes of Arizona it is customary for the women to
wear a strip of sheep-skin, called a “chogan;” when the necessity for
its use has disappeared, the woman goes outside of the village and conceals
it in the forks of one of the cedar or juniper trees so numerous in
the mountains. The author once found one of these; but the people
with him were impressed with the idea that no good would come from
being near it. At another time he knew of a young boy who had been
hit by a “chogan” which had been dislodged by a wind-storm. He
was almost frantic with terror, and devoted three or four days to singing
and to washing in a “sweat-bath.”</p>

<p>The Ostiaks of Siberia would seem to have the same ideas on this
subject as the Apaches and Navajoes have.—(See Pallas, “Voyages,”
vol. iv. p. 95.)</p>

<p>Danielus Beckherius informs his readers that menstrual blood was
used in medicine (pp. 23 <i>et seq.</i>); philters were prepared from it (idem,
p. 341). “Zenith juvencarum sc. sanguines menstruum” were
given for epilepsy,—that is, the first menses of a girl (idem, p. 42).
The lint of the napkin itself was thus given also (idem),—“litura
pannorum menstruorum datur patienti sanari morbum comitialium.”
The first napkin used by a healthy virgin was preserved for use in
cases of plague, malignant carbuncles, etc., dampened with water and
laid on the part affected; also used in erysipelas (idem, p. 43, “Med.
Microcosmus”). Dried catamenia were given internally for calculi,
epilepsy, etc., and externally for podagra; they were also used in treatment
of the plague, for carbuncles, aposthumes, being placed thereon
with a rag wet with rosewater or oil, into which menstrual fluid had
been poured; it was good as a cosmetic to drive away pimples (p. 265).</p>

<p>To restrain an immoderate flow of the menses a napkin was saturated
with menstrual blood, and then kept for a certain time in an aperture
made in the bark of a cherry-tree. “Ad immodicum menstruorum
fluxum cohibendum sunt qui pannum menstruum sanguine imbutum
certo tempore cerasi radice in cortice apertæ indunt, incisuramque
iterum operiunt.”—(Etmuller, “Op. Omnia;” Schrod. “Dil. Zoöl.,”
vol. ii. p. 265.)</p>

<p>Paullini prescribes the “dried catamenia of women” for the cure of
kidney diseases (pp. 142, 143), also for ring-worm, felons, menstrual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
troubles. Frommann gives the same cure for immoderate menses, by
placing the napkin in a cherry-tree.—(See “Tract. de Fascinatione,”
p. 1006.)</p>

<p>“Excoriationi conferunt ... sanguis menstruus.”—(Avicenna,
vol. i. p. 388.)</p>

<p>According to Flemming, menstrual blood was believed to be so
powerful that the mere touch of a menstruating woman would render
vines and all kinds of fruit-trees sterile (herein he seems to be following
Pliny). It was believed to be valuable medicinally in relieving
obstructions to the menstrual flow of other women; even the soiled
smock of a woman who had menstruated happily was efficacious in
assisting another woman whose menses for any cause were retarded.
A small portion of the menses, dried and taken internally, mitigated
the ailment known as dysmenorrhœa. Flemming states that, while in
his time this remedy had been gradually superseded, its use was still
kept up among the poor and ignorant, in erysipelas, face-blotches, and
as an ingredient in an ointment for podagra or gout.—(“De Remediis,”
pp. 16, 17.)</p>

<p>The Laplanders “say that they can stop a vessel in the middle of its
course, and that the only remedy against the power of this charm is
the sprinkling of female purgations, the odor of which is insupportable
to evil spirits.”—(“Regnard’s Journey to Lapland,” in Pinkerton,
vol. i. p. 180.)</p>

<p>“To cure a young woman of consumption she was given monthly
discharges to drink.”—(“Dutchess County, New York,” 1832, Mr.
Joseph Y. Bergen, Jr., Cambridge, Mass.)</p>

<p>Isaiah compareth our justice “panno menstruatæ.”—(Harington,
“Ajax,” p. 24.)</p>

<p>“Crines fœminæ menstruosæ, the haires of a menstruous woman
are turned into serpents within short space.”—(Scot, “Discoverie,”
p. 221.)</p>

<p>“Men have a special objection to see the blood of women at certain
times; they say that if they were to see it they would not be able to
fight against their enemies and would be killed.” (Mrs. James Smith,
“The Roandik Tribes,” p. 5.) Hence, although bleeding is a common
Australian cure among men, women are not allowed to be bled.
(Angas, vol. i. p. 3.) “This aversion is perhaps the explanation of that
seclusion of women at puberty, childbirth, etc., which has assumed
different forms in many parts of the world.”—(“Totemism,” Frazer,
p. 54, footnote.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<p>Old women were suspected of using the first menstrual flow of a
young girl in love-philters.—(Samuel Augustus Flemming, “De
Remediis.”)</p>

<p>“For colic take the scrapings of the nails of a catamenial virgin,
mix with water, and take.”—(Sagen-Märchen, Volksaberglauben aus
Schwaben, Freiburg, 1861, p. 487.)</p>

<p>There were many curious ideas prevalent in olden times as to the
manner in which the basilisk or cockatrice could be engendered. “Si
l’on place dans une gourde de verre du sang menstruel, et si l’on fait
putréfier celui-ci dans le ventre d’un cheval, il en naît un basilic.”—(“Mélusine,”
Paris, January-February, 1890, p. 19.)</p>

<p>Although the Israelites had many notions in common with the
American Indians on the subject of the catamenial fluid, and the
seclusion of women undergoing purgation, there does not seem to have
been any effort made to preserve or to hide the cloths used on such
occasions. Thus the Prophet Isaiah (lxiv. 6) says of the idols of the
Gentiles that they must be cast aside as the napkins soiled with the
menses. “Hoc est disperges ea (de idolis loquitur) sicut immunditionem
menstruatæ.”—(Contributed by Doctor Robert Fletcher.)</p>

<p>References to use of the catamenial fluid in witchcraft will be found
in Beckherius, quoting Josephus:</p>

<p>Menstruating women were excluded from the Jewish synagogues and
from the communion table of the early Christian Church: “Menstruatæ
mulieres superstitiose exclusæ ab ecclesia.”—(Baronius, “Annales,”
Lucca, 1758, tome 3, 266, xi.)</p>

<h3>AFTER-BIRTH AND LOCHIÆ.</h3>

<p>Both of these were used medicinally; the lochiæ were useful in restraining
uterine hemorrhages; after-birth, dried and powdered, deprived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
love-philters of their power; it was used as an anti-epileptic,
to relieve retention of the menses, etc. (See Flemming, “De Remediis,”
p. 17.) Secundines were used in the treatment of epilepsy.—(See
Etmuller, vol ii. p. 265).</p>

<h3>HUMAN SEMEN.</h3>

<p>Etmuller knew nothing of the remedial value of human semen beyond
the fact that Paracelsus had recommended its use in some cases
(vol. ii. p. 272).</p>

<p>Pliny mentions the use of human semen as a medicine (lib. xxviii. c.
10).</p>

<p>The savage Australians have “a last and most disgusting remedy
... deemed infallible in the most extreme cases.... ‘Mulierem ob
juventutem firmitatemque corporis lectam sex vel plures viri in locum
haud procul a castris remotum deducant. Ibique omnes deinceps in
illa libidinem explent. Tum mulier ad pedes surgere jubetur quo
facilius id quod maribus excepit effluere possit. Quod in vase collectum
ægrotanti ebibendum præbent.’ The aborigines have unbounded
faith in this truly horrible dose, and enumerate many, many instances
where it has effected marvellous cures. We, however, have known of
its having been administered in several cases without the remotest
revivifying result. It may be that this fluid is—in fact some savants
positively assert that it is so—the very essence of life, as well as containing
the germs thereof, and that administering a draught thereof to
a patient slowly but surely dying from exhaustion, consequent upon a
long fit of illness (the illness itself having died out or been cured)
might have the wonderful effect detailed so positively by the natives;
but this is a question for physicians to decide.”—(“The Abor. of
Victoria and Riverina,” Melbourne, 1889, p. 55, P. Beveridge, received
through the kindness of the Royal Soc., Sydney, N. S. Wales, F. B.
Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>“Impetigine conferunt ... sperma.”—(Avicenna, vol. i. p. 330,
a 10.)</p>

<p>For gout Avicenna prescribed “Sanguis menstruus,” “Sperma
hominis” (vol. i. p. 330, a 12; idem, a 13); “Sanguis menstruus
calidus” (vol. i. p. 388, b 9); also “Stercus caprarum” (vol. i. p. 390,
a 13). Consult also what has been said of this secretion under “Love-philters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span></p>

<h3>HUMAN BLOOD.</h3>

<p>The medicinal employment of human blood is described by Pliny
(lib. xxviii. cap. 105).</p>

<p>Beckherius says that human blood was employed in the treatment
of epilepsy. Faustina, the wife of the philosophical emperor, Marcus
Antoninus, anxious to have a child, drank the warm blood of a dying
gladiator, and then shared her husband’s bed, and at once became pregnant,
and brought forth the cruel Commodus. Human blood was also
used in effecting “sympathetic cures.”—(“Medic. Microcos.” pp. 122,
128.)</p>

<p>But it was essential that the human blood so employed should be
pure and undefiled; lovers who wished to increase the affection of
their mistresses, were recommended to try an infusion of their own
blood into the loved one’s veins. The blood of man and also that of
some animals, notably the dog, sheep, etc., were employed in mania,
delirium, cancer, etc. The method of transfusion was preferred.
Epileptics would sometimes drink a draught of the warm blood caught
gushing from the neck of a decapitated criminal; the blood of a man,
just decapitated, drunk warm, cured epilepsy and restrained uterine
hemorrhage.—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 272.)</p>

<p>Grimm alludes to the fact that the blood of innocent maids and boys
was used as a remedy for leprosy; that of malefactors, in epilepsy.—(“Teut.
Mythol.” vol. iii. p. 1173.)</p>

<p>See the discussion of this matter under the caption of “Human
Skulls.” Consult the work “Blood-Covenant,” by Dr. H. C. Trumbull.</p>

<p>In regard to the conduct of the empress Faustina, see “History of
the Inquisition,” Henry C. Lea, N. Y. 1889, vol. iii. p. 391.</p>

<h3>HUMAN SKIN, FLESH, AND TALLOW.</h3>

<p>Girdles of human skin were regarded as efficacious in helping women
in labor; Etmuller, in his “Comment. Ludovic.” disapproves of their
use, but, in another part of his works, describes how and for what purposes
they were to be employed.</p>

<p>“Corium humanum et ex inde paratum cingulum magni est usu in
suffocatione uterina arcenda, uti etiam in pellendo fœto mortuo, item
in partu difficile” (vol. ii. p. 272).</p>

<p>References to such girdles or belts, called “cingulæ” or “chirothecæ”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
are to be found in the writings of Samuel Augustus Flemming
and others.</p>

<p>Human flesh, of corpses, was administered under the name of
“Mummy.” (See Beckherius, “Med. Microcos.” p. 263 <i>et seq.</i>) He
enumerates no less than fifty prescriptions for all sorts of ailments.
The “mummy” should be from a malefactor, hanged on a gibbet,
never buried, and the age should have been between 25 and 40, of
good constitution, without organic or other diseases, and gathered in
clear weather.</p>

<p>Human flesh occurs in recipes in “The Chyrurgeon’s Closet,” London,
1632, pp. 6, 53.</p>

<p>Andrew Lang refers to the use of “mummy powder” by the physicians
of the Court of Charles II.—(“Myth,” etc. vol. i. p. 96.)</p>

<p>Human tallow was employed in medicine, rendered from the skin
and other parts. It was regarded as efficacious in eradicating small-pox
pustules, while an “oleum Philosophorum” was distilled from it
and held in high repute for tumors, catarrhal troubles, affections of the
ear, etc.—(Flemming, “De Remediis,” p. 9.)</p>

<p>Human flesh “mumia,” was recommended in the preparation of the
best “Paracelsus salve.... Recommended for cure of bruises and
against congealed blood.... Most excellent and most approved
medicines.”</p>

<h3>HUMAN SKULL.—BRAIN.—MOSS GROWING ON HUMAN SKULL.—MOSS
GROWING ON STATUE.—LICE.</h3>

<p>Democritus thought, in his Memoirs, quoted by Pliny, that “the
skull of a malefactor is most efficacious.... While, for the treatment
of others, that of one who has been a friend or guest is required.”
(Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 2.) ... “Skull of a man who has been slain,”
and “whose body remains unburnt.... Skull of a man who has been
hanged.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“Xenocrates, who, says Galen, flourished two generations or sixty
years before him, writes with an air of confidence on the good effects
to be obtained by eating of the human brain, flesh, or liver; by swallowing
in drink the burnt or unburnt bones of the head, shin, or fingers
of a man, or the blood.”—(“Saxon Leechdoms,” lib. i. p. 18.)</p>

<p>“Against a boring worm ... burn to ashes a man’s head-bone or
skull; put it on with a pipe.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 127, article “Leech
Book.”)</p>

<p>Paracelsus gives the recipe for distilling “The Oyle of the Skull of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
Man.... Take the skull of a man that was never buried, and beate it
into powder.” (“The Secrets of Physicke,” Theophrastus Paracelsus,
Eng. transl. London, 1633, p. 97.) “The dose is three grains against
the falling sickness.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Schurig notes that the human skull is a remedy for the falling sickness.—(See
“Chylologia.”)</p>

<p>The skull of a man was used for diseases of men; that of a woman,
for diseases of women.—(See “Rare Secrets in Physicke,” collected
by the Comtesse of Kent, London, 1654, p. 3.)</p>

<p>Beckherius prescribed it in cephalic affections, epilepsy, paralysis,
apoplexy, vertigo, etc., taken in powder, or raw, simply or in combination.—(“Medicus
Microcosmus,” p. 199 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>But the skull was, preferentially, “Cranii humani nunquam
sepulti” (p. 217); or, “Cranii humani violenter mortui” (p. 266).
Moss from such a skull was also used medicinally (idem, p. 237). If
possible, it should be that of a man who had been executed on a
scaffold, “patibula.”</p>

<p>“Powder of a man’s bones, burnt, chiefly of the skull that is found
in the earth, given, cureth the epilepsy. The bones of a man cureth a
man, the bones of a woman, cureth a woman.” But the patient had
to abstain from wine for nine days.—(“The Poor Man’s Physician,”
John Moncrief, Edin. 1716, p. 70.)</p>

<p>“Os hominis adustum,” a cure for epilepsy (Avicenna, vol. i. p. 330
a 18); “Mumia” (idem, vol. i. p. 357, a 55); “Ossa hominis in potu
data” (idem, vol. i. p. 371, a 6).</p>

<p>Epilepsie. “Take pilles made of the skull of one that is hanged.”—(Reg.
Scot. “Discoverie,” p. 175.)</p>

<p>The skulls of ancestors were used as drinking cups by the Tibetans,
according to Rubruquis, in Purchas (vol. i. p. 23).</p>

<p>“Among primitive people the head is peculiarly sacred.”—(“The
Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 187.)</p>

<p>Dr. Bernard Schaff gives the following formula for the cure of
fevers: “Take a human skull from among those not enclosed in tombs,
and calcine it in a crucible or in the open fire; administer in doses of
from one scruple to half a dram an hour or two before the paroxysm
of the fever.” He adds that among the common people the belief
prevailed that the skull should be obtained at the early dawn of day,
about the time of the winter solstice, and with the ceremonies (<i>sacris</i>)
peculiar to that season, that it should be picked up in silence; but for
his part he does not believe in such things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span></p>

<p>“Recipitur cranium humanum ex ipsis quoque sepulchrorum claustris
depromptum (vulgus addit tempore matutino ante Solis ortum
sub sacris angeronæ, hoc est, ore tacito, aufferatur, quod tamen, cum
aliquam sapere videatur superstitionem, imitari nolui) et vel igne
aperto, vel in crucibulo, calcinatur, usquedem colorem acquirat cineritium
pulverisatum hocce cranium adhibetur a ℈ i. ad ʒ; i. vel ii. horas
ante paroxysmi principio.”—(“Ephem. Phys. Medic.,” Leipzig, 1694,
vol. ii. p. 93.)</p>

<p>The skull of a malefactor who had died on the scaffold or wheel,
and which had been exposed in the open air long enough to make it
perfectly dry and white, was considered a specific in epilepsy, being much
superior for that purpose to the skulls obtained from graveyards.</p>

<p>Soldiers thought that if they drank from a human skull before going
into battle they would secure immunity from the weapons of the enemy.
This belief undoubtedly came into Europe with the Scythians.</p>

<p>“Milites putant, si quis ex cranio humano hauriat potum fore ut sit
immunis ab insultis armorum.”—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 268, 269.)</p>

<p>Etmuller also shows that these skulls were ground up and administered
to epileptic patients, many modes of preparation and administration
being given.</p>

<p>Flemming wrote that human skull was considered a potent remedy
in all ailments for which practitioners would administer human brain,—that
is, in nerve troubles and in epilepsy. Preferably, the skull
should be taken from a corpse which had died a violent death,—“Quæ
e cadavere violenta morte extincto est desumta.” It was an
ingredient in many preparations bearing the high-sounding titles
of “majesterium epilepticum,” “specificum cephalicum,” etc. As a
powder, ground raw or calcined, it was sometimes administered as a
febrifuge and in paralysis.—(“De Remediis,” p. 10.)</p>

<p>Mr. W. W. Rockhill states that the Lamas of Thibet use skulls in
their religious ceremonies, but reject those which smell like human
urine. “Blood of a dead man’s skull” used to check hemorrhage.—(Pettigrew,
“Med. Superst.,” p. 113.)</p>

<p>“There is a divination-bowl,—an uncanny object, made of the inverted
cranium of a Buddhist priest.”—(“Tidbits from Tibet,” in the
“Evening Star,” Washington, D. C., Nov. 3, 1888, describing the
W. W. Rockhill collection in the National Museum.)</p>

<p>Before the coming of the whites the savages of Australia employed
human skulls as drinking-vessels,—“human skulls with the sutures
stopped up with a resinous gum.”—(“Native Tribes of S. Australia,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
Adelaide, 1879, received through the kindness of the Royal Society,
Sydney, New South Wales, F. B. Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>“The powder of a man’s bones, and particularly that made from a
skull found in the earth, was esteemed in Scotland as a cure for epilepsy.
As usual, the form runs that the bones of a man will cure a
man, and the bones of a woman will cure a woman. Grose notes the
merits of the moss found growing upon a human skull, if dried and
powdered and taken as snuff, in cases of headache.” (Black, “Folk-Medicine,”
p. 96.) He also informs us that the same beliefs and the
same remedy obtained in England and Ireland.</p>

<p>“Among the articles which may be regarded more as household
furniture ... are the dried human skulls, which are found wrapped
in banana-leaves in the habitation of nearly every well-regulated Dyak
family. They are hung up on the wall, or depend from the roof. The
lower jaw is always wanting, as the Dyak finds it more convenient to
decapitate his victim below the occiput, leaving the lower jaw attached
to his body.”—(“Head-Hunters of Borneo,” Carl Bock, London, 1881,
p. 199.)</p>

<p>The careful manner in which the Mandans preserved the skulls of
their dead, as narrated by Catlin, is recalled to mind.</p>

<h3>MOSS GROWING ON HUMAN SKULLS.</h3>

<p>The medicinal use of the moss growing on the skulls of those who
had died violent deaths is mentioned by Von Helmont.—(“Oritrika,”
p. 768.)</p>

<p>Etmuller speaks of the <i>usnea</i>, or moss, growing on the skull of a
malefactor, which was given in cases of epilepsy (vol. ii. p. 273).</p>

<p>Flemming regarded such moss, if taken from the skull of a malefactor,
who had been hanged or broken on the wheel, as of great efficacy
in epilepsy, in brain troubles, and as a styptic for hemorrhages
(p. 11).</p>

<p>“Such a moss, if dried, powdered, and taken as snuff, will cure the
headache.”—(Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 277, article
“Physical Charms,” quoting Grose. The same reference is given by
Pettigrew, “Medical Superstitions,” p. 86.)</p>

<h3>HUMAN BRAIN.</h3>

<p>The human brain, dissolved or distilled in spirits of wine, was employed
in nerve troubles and as an anti-epileptic.—(Flemming, “De
Remediis ex Corpore Humano desumtis,” p. 10.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span></p>

<h3>LICE.</h3>

<p>One might infer that habits of personal cleanliness did not prevail in
England two centuries ago, judging from the terms of the following
prescription, which seemingly takes as a matter of course that the
patient could at any time obtain the insects needed:—</p>

<p>“For the cure of sore eyes ... take two or three lice out of one’s
head; put them under the lid.”—(“Rare Secrets in Physicke,” collected
by the Comtesse of Kent, London, 1654, p. 75.)</p>

<p>The author of this work knows, from disagreeable personal experience
and observation, that the Indians of North America very generally
were addicted to the disgusting practice of cleaning each other’s heads
and putting all captured prey in their mouths. Such an office was
considered a very delicate attention to be paid by a woman to her
husband or lover, or from male friend to male friend, while on a campaign.
No instance was noted of the use in a medical sense of these
troublesome parasites.</p>

<h3>MOSS GROWING ON THE HEAD OF A STATUE.</h3>

<p>“It is asserted that a plant growing on the head of a statue gathered
in the lappet of any one of the garments, and then attached with
a red string to the neck, is an instantaneous cure for the headache.”
(Pliny, lib. xxiv. c. 106.) This would seem to be germane to the idea
of moss growing on the human skull.</p>

<h3>WOOL.</h3>

<p>“The ancient Romans attributed to wool a degree of religious importance
even; and it was in this spirit that they enjoined that the
bride should touch the door-posts of her husband’s house with wool.”—(Pliny,
lib. xxix. cap. 10.)</p>

<p>In Cumberland, England, a reputed cure for earache is the application
of a bit of wool from a black sheep, moistened in cow’s urine.
Possibly it is a modified form of this latter notion that is found at
Mount Desert, where it is said that the wool must be wet in new milk;
while in Vermont, to be efficacious, it is thought that the wool must
be gathered from the left side of the neck of a perfectly black sheep.
In other localities, negro’s wool is a reputed cure for the same pain.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible, whatever their origin, that remedies of so
offensive a character as many of those above given can still retain a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
place even in the rudest traditional pharmacopœia; but there seems to
be in the uneducated human mind a sort of reverence for or faith in
that which is in itself disagreeable or repulsive. This idea apparently
rules instead of rational judgment in the selection of many popular
remedies in the shape of oils of the most loathsome description, such
as “skunk-oil,” “angle-worm oil” (made by slowly rendering earth-worms
in the sun), “snake-oil” of various kinds, etc.—(“Animal and
Plant Lore,” Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, in “Popular Science Monthly,”
New York, September, 1888, p. 658.)</p>

<p class="tb">In the application of human blood and human skulls just presented,
one feature must be patent to the most superficial student; in the
treatment of epilepsy, the blood or the skull was, preferentially, to be
that of a dying gladiator or a criminal. There was evidently a reason
for this, beyond mere expediency.</p>

<p>Gladiatorial games were instituted as sacred games, in which the
victims to be offered in sacrifice were determined by the destiny of
the combat. Long after man’s better reason and better nature had
revolted against the loathsome rites of human sacrifice, religion and
custom still held him in their clutches. He would not offer up his
own progeny, as of yore, but he still continued to immolate captives
taken in war, as so many gladiators had been, or offenders against
the laws.</p>

<p>The victim generally shared with the sacrificing priest the honor
of representing the deity in whose name his life was to be taken.
Consequently he became holy; everything belonging to him became
“medicine,” and in no disease could it be administered more efficaciously
than in epilepsy,—the essentially “sacred disease” (morbus
sacer) sent direct from the gods.</p>

<p>Moreover, criminals executed for violations of the laws of conquering
nations, or for infractions of the discipline, or contempt of the doctrines
of a triumphant religion, might, by the conquered rustics, who still
cherished a half-concealed veneration for the old rulers and supplanted
rites, be looked upon as martyrs, whose bones, blood, and crania
would relieve disease and drive away misfortune.</p>

<p>The idea of sanctity, too, attached to “innocent maids and boys,”
whose undefiled blood might rectify the polluted fluid that coursed
languidly through the veins of the leper.</p>

<p>The belief that the gods are to be gratified and propitiated by the
spectacle of human suffering, especially when self-inflicted, has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
current from the first ages of the world, and will most probably last,
in one form or another, as long as the world shall last. It has cropped
out in every shape, from the rigorous abstinence of the ascetic to the
brutal flagellation of the fanatical devotee, and from that to the emasculation
of the Galli, the Khlysthi, and the Hottentot, and the
self-immolation of the servant of Juggernath. Maurice enumerates
five different kinds of meritorious suicide yet recognized in Hindostan,
and we have no reason for refusing to believe that our own ancestors
were saturated with the same false notions, which, retaining their
hold upon the minds of an illiterate peasantry, would surround with
the mystery of holiness any act of self-destruction attributable to
mania or other impulse supposed to be from on high.</p>

<h3>BONES AND TEETH.—MARROW.</h3>

<p>“If a circle is traced round an ulcer with a human bone, it will be
effectually prevented from spreading.”—(Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 11.)</p>

<p>Etmuller believed that by the use of an unbroken human bone it
was possible to induce as copious a purgation as might be desired.
“Beneficio ossis humani integri potest fieri purgatio artificialis tanta
quantum volumus,” etc.—(Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 273.)</p>

<p>“‘Holy oyle of dead men’s bones,’ good for the ‘falling sickness.’”—(“The
Newe Jewell of Health,” George Baker, Chirurgeon, London,
1576, black letter, p. 170.)</p>

<p>Beckherius prescribed human bones in medicine.—(See “Med. Microcos.,”
p. 252 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Etmuller, not content with prescribing the bones ground into powder,
also directed the administration of human marrow (vol. ii. p. 268).</p>

<h3>HUMAN TEETH.</h3>

<p>“A tooth taken from a body before burial,” worn as an amulet,
cured toothache.—(Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 12.)</p>

<p>“The first tooth that a child has shed,” worn as an amulet, protects
from pain in the uterus.—(Idem, lib. xxviii. c. 7.)</p>

<p>Pounded dead men’s teeth were used in fumigating the genitalia
of persons “ligated” by witchcraft.—(See Frommann, “Tract. de
Fascin.,” p. 965.)</p>

<p>Etmuller taught that the teeth were similar to the bones, and used
in the alleviation of the same infirmities. Those drawn from the jaws
of a man who had died a violent death were highly commended for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
all sickness brought on by witchcraft, as well as for loss of virility.
“Ossibus similes sunt dentes, qui ipsi ex homine imprimis violenta
morte interempto commendatur ad morbos per veneficium, si nimium
et illis fiat suffitus; item in impotentia” (vol. ii. p. 273).</p>

<p>“Si dentes pueri, imprimis cum cadunt, suspendantur antequam ad
terram deveniant et ponantur in lamina argenti et suspendantur supra
mulieres eas prohibent impregnari et parere” (idem, p. 263).</p>

<p>Teeth are worn as amulets by pregnant women or ground into
powder, and taken in a potion; in both forms, believed to be useful in
averting the plague. Powdered teeth, drunk in wine, cured epilepsy,
and restored impaired virility.—(Flemming, “De Remediis,” p. 13.)</p>

<p>“Knock a tooth that is pulled out into the bark of a young tree.”—(Grimm,
“Teutonic Mythology,” vol. iii. p. 1173.)</p>

<p>Human teeth, bones, and other parts of dead bodies are still used
by the negroes in our Southern States in their “voudoo” ceremonies,
and as charms, in the old-time belief that their possession secures a
man invisibility. See an article on this subject in the “Evening
Star,” of Washington, D. C., January 1, 1889.</p>

<p>“In North Hants, a tooth taken from the mouth of a corpse is often
enveloped in a little bag and worn around the neck to secure the
wearer against headache.... In the northeast of Scotland, the sufferer
was required to pull with his own teeth a tooth from the skull.”—(“Folk-Medicine,”
Black, p. 98.)</p>

<p>The use of human teeth and fingers as “charms,” “amulets,” and
“medicine,” will be treated of in another work, at greater length. At
present it will be sufficient to call attention to the great potency associated
in the minds of the American aborigines with such relics. The
author obtained, in one of General Crook’s campaigns, in a battle with
the Northern Cheyennes, in northern Wyoming, in the winter of 1876,
a necklace of human fingers, the prized adornment and “medicine”
of the chief medicine-man. This curious link between the savagery
of America and the superstitions of Europe is now in the National
Museum, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Flemming prescribed the ground bones of criminals (raw or burnt),
as an internal medicine for gout, dysentery, etc.; but he did not limit
himself to human bones, as he expressly states that, as a substitute,
the bones of horses, asses, or other beasts could be employed. (“De
Remediis,” p. 12.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span></p>

<h3>TARTAR IMPURITIES FROM THE TEETH.</h3>

<p>Paullini goes so far as to recommend the use of the tartar impurities
from the teeth, and the dirt from soiled stockings, as a remedy for
nose-bleed. (Paullini, p. 52.)</p>

<p>In this he most probably follows an ancient line of practice, of
which other authors have neglected to give a detailed account. Galen
and others have shown that the scrapings from the body, and all
other “sordes” were used medicinally, and there was no reason why
dental tartar should not be added to the materia medica.</p>

<h3>RENAL AND BILIARY CALCULI.—HUMAN BILE.</h3>

<p>Calculi were used in the treatment of calculary troubles and in
childbirth.—(Pliny, lib. xxvii. cap. 9. See also Galen.)</p>

<p>Prescribed for stone in the bladder or kidneys by Beckherius.—(“Med.
Microcosmus,” pp. 167-170.)</p>

<p>Flemming advocates the same use of them.—(“De Remediis,”
p. 23.)</p>

<p>“A man’s stone, drunk fasting, is most powerful of any to break the
stone and expel it with the urine.”—(“The Poor Man’s Physician,”
Moncrief, p. 131.)</p>

<p>Flemming also used biliary calculi in the cure of yellow jaundice.—(“De
Remediis,” p. 14.)</p>

<p>Human bile was used internally in epilepsy, and externally in deafness
and ulcerations of the ear.—(Idem.)</p>

<h3>BEZOAR STONES.—LYNCURIUS.</h3>

<p>From the most ancient times there were used in the medical practice
of Europe certain stones, known as belemnites, thunder-stones,
lyncurius, etc., believed to be efficacious in treatment of stone in the
bladder. This lyncurius was regarded as the coagulated urine of the
lynx, and under that phase of the case properly comes within the scope
of this volume.—(See “Pomet on Drugs,” English translation, London,
1738, p. 408.)</p>

<p>The “bezoar” stone, so frequently alluded to by old writers, was
simply excrementitious matter hardened in an animal’s stomach.</p>

<h3>COSMETICS.</h3>

<p>Pigeon’s dung was applied externally for all spots and blemishes on
the face. (Pliny, lib. xxx. cap. 9.) Mouse-dung, externally, for lichens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
(Idem.) “Brand Marks” (stigmata) were removed by using pigeon’s
dung diluted in vinegar. (Idem, lib. xxx. cap 10.) Crocodile-dung, or
“crocodilea,” removed blemishes from the face. (Idem, lib. xxxviii.
caps. 29, 50.) It also removed freckles.</p>

<p>“An application of bull-dung, they say, will impart a rosy tint to
the cheeks, and not even crocodilea is better for the purpose.”—(Idem,
lib. xxviii. cap. 50.)</p>

<p>Galen alludes to the extensive use as a cosmetic, by the Greek and
Roman ladies, of the dung of the crocodile; in the same manner, the
dung of starlings that had been fed on rice alone was employed.—(Galen,
“Opera Omnia,” Kuhn’s edition, lib. xxx. p. 308.)</p>

<p>Dioscorides prescribed crocodile-dung as a beautifier of the faces of
women.—(“Mat. Med.,” vol. i. p. 222 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Bull-dung was used by women as a cosmetic to remove all facial
blemishes.—(Sextus Placitus, “De Med. ex Animal.,” article “De
Tauro.”)</p>

<p>The urine of a boy took away freckles from a face washed with it.
“Ad profluvium mulieris, si locum sæpe lotio viri laverit.” For birthmarks
on children take the crust which gathers on urine standing in
chamber-pots, break up and bake; place the child in the bath, and
rub the marks well. “Ad maculas infantium, matellæ quæ crustem
ex lotio duxerint, fractæ et coctæ, in balneo infantem, si ex eo unxeris
omnia supra-scripta emendat.”—(Idem, “De Puello et Puella
Virgine.”)</p>

<p>Beckherius approved of the use of the meconium of infants to erase
birthmarks.—(“Med. Microcos.,” p. 113.)</p>

<p>Etmuller states that from cow-dung, as well as from human ordure,
by repeated digestion and distillation and sublimation, was prepared
“Zibethum Occidentale,” so named by Paracelsus. From this was
distilled the “water of all flowers,” so termed because the cattle had
eaten so many flowers in their pasturage. This was passing good as a
cosmetic to remove pimples and all kinds of blotches.</p>

<p>Human ordure itself was made use of for the same purpose (vol. ii.
p. 171).</p>

<p>Dog-urine was prescribed to restore the color of the hair.—(Avicenna,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span></p>

<p>“Alopecia” (baldness) was cured by mouse-dung (idem, vol. i. p. 360,
b 50), and by “stercus caprarum.”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 389, b 53.)</p>

<p>“Urina canis putrefacta conservat nigredinem capillorum.”—(Idem,
vol. ii. p. 333, a 50.)</p>

<p>Réclus says that even now, in Paris, many people who have within
reach the best of toilet waters prefer to use urine as a detersive.—(See
“Les Primitifs,” p. 72, “Les Inoits Occidentaux.”)</p>

<p>The Ove-herero, living south of Angola, West Africa, rub their
bodies with dry cow-dung to impart lustre.—(“Muhongo,” interpreted
by Rev. Mr. Chatelain.)</p>

<p>“Aqua omnium florum” was distilled from the dung of cows dropped
in the month of May. “Verno seu Maiali tempore ... ex stercore
recenti vaccæ herbas depascentis.” (Etmuller, vol. ii. p. 249.) “Ex
hoc ipso stercore, eodem modo atque ex stercore humano per digestionem
et sublimationem, repetitam potest preparari Zibethum Occidentale,
sic dictum a Paracelso, quoniam suavem spirat instar Zibethi.
Destillatur aqua ex hoc stercore quæ vocatur aqua omnium florum,
quia bos innumeris floribus vescitur; hæc aqua omnium florum est
singulare cosmeticum applicatum externe delendis nævis et maculis in
facie.”—(Etmuller, vol. ii. pp. 249, 250.)</p>

<p>Some people added to this a “water distilled from the sperm of
frogs.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 171, 172.)</p>

<p>Catamenial blood was supposed to be a remedy for pimples on the
face. (Idem, p. 265.) In portions of Northern Mexico the women
apply it to their faces as a beautifier.</p>

<p>Cow-dung was very generally relied upon in this sense. The dung
of a black cow entered into the composition of the celebrated “Eau de
Mille Fleurs.” The ordure of small lizards was also used to smooth
out the wrinkles from the faces of old women.</p>

<p>Fox-dung and the dung of sparrows and starlings were in use for
softening the hands. Arabian women use as a cosmetic a mixture of
saffron and chicken-dung. Cow-dung is sometimes as aromatic as
musk. It used to be employed to restore the odor to old and faded
musk, or to hang the latter in a privy, where it would re-acquire
its former strength; but would not retain it long (see under
“Latrines”).</p>

<p>To improve the complexion Paullini recommended a water distilled
from human excrements; also the worms that grow therein
distilled to a water. The cosmetic of country wenches is their own
urine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>Human excrements have peculiar salts more strengthening and useful
than soap. A young girl improved her complexion wonderfully by
washing her face in cow-dung and drinking her brother’s urine fresh
and warm, while fasting (pp. 263, 264).</p>

<p>Other cosmetics commended by Paullini were human ordure, externally;
the ordure of a young boy, internally; “Eau de Millefleurs,”
the excreta of lizards, crocodiles, foxes, sparrows, starlings, chickens, or
of cows gathered in May, externally.</p>

<p>See also pages 172, 207.</p>

<p>For the eradication of freckles Paullini also recommended the external
application of the excrement of donkeys, dogs, chickens, crocodiles,
foxes, or pigeons.</p>

<p>Schurig was a champion of “Aqua ex stercore distillata,” for all
facial embellishment.—(“Chylologia,” p. 762.)</p>

<p>“Il y a plus; les femmes les plus belles s’en sont barbouillé le
visage, et Saint Jérome le reproche durement aux dames de son
temps.” In a footnote is added this explanation: “On a employé
des excrémens de quelques lézards d’Egypte comme cosmétique, à
cause de leur odeur musquée.” (“Bib. Scat.,” p. 21.) “Merde de
Lézard c’est le cordilea, excrément du stellion du Levant, employé
comme cosmétique.”—(Idem, p. 123.)</p>

<p>“Wash the face with the diaper on which a new-born babe has
urinated for the first time, it will remove freckles.”—(Cape Breton,
Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, Cambridge, Mass.)</p>

<p>This belief in the cosmetic power of the first renal discharge of a
child is generally diffused all over the United States.</p>

<p>“Enfin, les nourrices entre nous, ont l’habitude de frotter la figure
de leurs nourrissons avec les langes imbibés de leur urine. Cela les
fait venir beau, disent-elles, cela combat en tout cas, certaines efflorescences
cutanées chez les enfants, par l’ammoniaque.”—(Personal
letter from Doctor Bernard, Cannes, France.)</p>

<p>Prof. Patrice de Janon states that the ladies of his native place,
Carthagena, South America, to his personal knowledge, were in the
habit of using their own urine as a face lotion, and to beautify and
soften the skin.</p>

<p>Horse-dung was another face lotion.—(“A Rich Storehouse or
Treasurie for the Diseased,” Ralph Blower, London, 1616, p. 106.)</p>

<p>Goose-dung is in repute in the State of Indiana for removing pimples.—(Mrs.
Bergen.)</p>

<p>Mr. Sylvester Baxter says that young women in Massachusetts, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
least until very recently, have employed human urine as a wash for
the preservation of the complexion.</p>

<p>“Water that stands in the concavity of a patch of cow-dung” is the
belief in Walden, Mass., according to Mrs. Bergen, who thus shows a
transplantation of the same belief which has lingered in Europe from
remote ages.</p>

<span class="smaller">AMULETS AND TALISMANS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>As a connecting link between pharmacy proper and the antidotes to
the effects of witchcraft, and at the same time fully deserving of a
separate place on its own merits, may be inserted a chapter upon
talismans and amulets made of excrementitious materials.</p>

<p>“From the cradle, modern Englishmen are taught to fight an angry
battle against superstition, and they treat a talisman or charm with
some disdain and contempt. But let us reflect that those playthings
tended to quiet and reassure the patient, to calm his temper, and soothe
his nerves,—objects, which, if we are not misinformed, the best practitioners
of our own day willingly obtain by such means as are left
them.</p>

<p>“Whether a wise physician will deprive a humble patient of his roll
of magic words or take from his neck the fairy stone, I do not know;
but this is certain, that the Christian church of that early day, and the
medical science of the empire by no means refused the employment of
these arts of healing, these balms of superstitious origin.</p>

<p>“The reader may enjoy his laugh at such devices, but let him remember
that dread of death and wakeful anxiety must be hushed by some
means, for they are very unfriendly to recovery from disease.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 11.)</p>

<p>Cat-dung, “to be attached to the body with the toe of a horned
owl” and “not to be removed until the seventh paroxysm is passed,”
was the amulet recommended by Pliny for the cure of the quartan
fever.—(Lib. xxviii. c. 66.)</p>

<p>Sextus Placitus, “De Puello et Puella Virgine,” recommends the
use of calculi to aid in the expulsion of calculi, either ground into a
powder or hung about the patient’s neck as an amulet; in the latter
case, he says, the cure is more gradual.</p>

<p>Roman matrons used a small stone found in the excrement of a hind
“attached to the body as an amulet,” as “a preventive of abortion.”—(Pliny,
lib. xxviii. c. 77.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span></p>

<p>In retarded dentition, there was a bag suspended from the infant’s
neck, in which was a powder, made of equal parts of the dung of hares,
wolves, and crows.—(Schurig, “Chylologia,” p. 820).</p>

<p>“Wolf’s dung, borne with one, helps the colic.”—(Burton, “Anatomy
of Melancholy,” vol. ii. p. 134.)</p>

<p>Burton, in his “Anatomy of Melancholy,” 1621, p. 476, has the following
passage on this subject: “Amulets I find prescribed; taxed by
some, approved by others.”—(Quoted by Brand, “Pop. Ant.” vol. ii.
p. 324, article “Amulets.”)</p>

<p>No explanation can be ventured upon for the following charm, which
had a very extended dissemination throughout Europe, and can be
traced back to “Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. x. p. 33.</p>

<p>“Many magic writings are simply invocations of the devil.... A
woman obtained an amulet to cure sore eyes. She refrained from
shedding tears and her eyes recovered. On a zealous friend opening
the paper, these words were found: “Der teufel kratze dir die augen
aus, und scheisse dir in die löcher,” and, naturally, when the woman
saw that it was in this she had trusted, she lost faith, began to weep
again, and in due time found her eyes as bad as ever. (“Folk Medicine,”
Black, p. 171.) The same charm was also, in other places,
written in Latin, in this form: “Diabolus effodiat tibi oculos, impleat
foramina stercoribus.” It is quoted by Pettigrew, in ”Medical Superstitions,”
p. 102; also by Brand, “Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 324, article
“Characts.”</p>

<p>Translated into English it is thus rendered by Reginald Scot:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The devil pull out both thine eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And etihs in the holes likewise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Spell the word backward and you shall see this charm.”—(“Discoverie
of witchcraft,” London, 1651, p. 178.)</p>

<p>“For diphtheria, a poultice consisting of the fresh excrement of the
hog, is worn about the neck for one night.” (Fayette County.)—(“Folk-Lore
of the Penn’a Germans,” in “Journal of American Folk-Lore,”
1889, p. 29, W. J. Hoffman, M. D.)</p>

<p>For diseases in the kidneys, as an amulet χαραβραωθ, which means
“viscera” in Hebrew: “In cubili canis urinam faciat qui urinam non
potest continere, dicatque dum facit, ne in cubili suo urinam ut canis
faciat.”—(“Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 31. See also under Grand
Lama, love-philters, mistletoe, witchcraft.)</p>

<p>Each and every one of the remedies inserted here under the title of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
“Witchcraft,” might with perfect propriety have been comprehended
under the caption of “Pharmacy,” but the intention was to differentiate
the two in the hope of attaining greater clearness in treatment. Under
“Pharmacy,” therefore, have been retained all remedies for the alleviation
of known disorders, while under “Witchcraft” are tabulated all
that were to be administered or applied for the amelioration of ailments
of an obscure type, the origin of which the ignorant sufferer would unhesitatingly
seek in the malevolence of supernatural beings or in the
machinations of human foes possessed of occult influences. Side by
side with these, very properly go all such aids as were believed to
insure better fortune in money-making, travelling, etc.</p>

<p>“A mixture of ape’s-dung and chameleon-dung was applied to the
doors of one’s enemy.... He will, through its agency, become the
object of universal hatred.”—(Pliny, lib. xxviii. c. 29.)</p>

<p>“The excrements (i. e. of the hyena) which have been voided by
the animal at the moment when killed, are looked upon as counter-charms
to magic spells.”—(Idem, c. 27.)</p>

<p>“For young girls they (i. e. the magicians) prescribe nine pellets of
hare’s dung to ensure a durable firmness to the breasts.”—(Idem,
c. 77.)</p>

<p>Doctor Dupouy believes that when the Druids “were forced to take
refuge in dense forests far removed from the people, persecuted by the
Romans, barbarians, and Christians, they progressively became magicians,
enchanters, prophets, and charmers, condemned by the Councils
and banished by the civil authority. It is at this epoch that evil
spirits were noticed prowling around in the shadows of night and indulging
in acts of obscene depravity.... In the seventh century
Druidism disappeared, but the practice of magic, occult art, and the
mysterious science of spirits were transmitted from generation to generation
but lessened in losing the philosophical character of ancient
times.”—(“Le Moyen Age Médical,” or its translation, “Physicians
in the Middle Ages,” T. C. Minor, M. D., Cincinnati, Ohio, p. 38.)</p>

<span class="smaller">WITCHCRAFT.—SORCERY.—CHARMS.—SPELLS.—INCANTATIONS.—MAGIC.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There is but one method of arriving at a correct understanding of
what witchcraft was, as known to civilized communities, and that
is by placing it under the lens of investigation as a mutilated and distorted
survival of a displaced religion.</p>

<p>The very earliest records of man’s thought, the alabaster and earthen
tablets of Chaldea and Assyria, allude to the evil eye, to incantations,
and to the fear of evil spirits, witches, and sorcerers.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, the Chaldean tablets do not leave us without any
insight into witchcraft, as their formulæ were destined to counteract
the effects of the sorceries of this impious art, as well as the spontaneous
action of demons.”—(“Chaldean Magic,” François Lenormant,
London, 1877, p. 59; for the Chaldean’s dread of the Evil Eye, see
the same work, p. 61.)</p>

<p>“One fine series (i. e. of Chaldean tablets) deals with remedies
against witchcraft.”—(“The Chaldean Account of Genesis,” George
Smith, New York, 1880, p. 28.)</p>

<p>“There is finally a third species of magic, thoroughly diabolical in
character, and openly acknowledging itself as such. This kind helps
to perpetuate ... by still believing in their power and transforming
them into dark practices, the rites of adoration of the ancient gods,
considered as demons after the triumph of the new religion, the exclusive
spirit of which repudiates all association with the remains of the
old worship. The enchanter in this case, far from considering himself
an inspired and divine personage, consents, provided he reaps all the
benefit of his magic practices, to be nothing more than the tool of the
bad and infernal powers. He himself sees devils in the ancient gods
evoked by his spells, but he nevertheless remains confident of their
protection; he engages himself in their service by compacts, and fancies
himself going to a witch-dance in their company. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
part of the magic of the Middle Ages bears this character and perpetuates
the popular and superstitious rites of paganism in the mysterious
and diabolical operations of sorcery. It is the same with the
magic of most Mussulman countries. In Ceylon, since the complete
conversion of the island to Buddhism, the ancient gods of Sivaism have
become demons, and their worship a guilty sorcery practised only by
enchanters.”—(“Chaldean Magic,” Lenormant, p. 77.)</p>

<p>Human and animal filth are mentioned in nearly every treatise upon
witchcraft, under three different heads:—</p>

<p>Firstly, as the means by which the sorcery is accomplished.</p>

<p>Secondly, as the antidote by which such machinations are frustrated.</p>

<p>Thirdly, as the means of detecting the witch’s personality.</p>

<p>Much that might have been included within this chapter has been
arranged under the caption of “Love-Philters” and “Child-Birth,”
and should be examined under those heads.</p>

<p>The subject of amulets and talismans is another that is so closely
connected with the matter of which we are now treating, that it must
be included in any investigation made in reference to it.</p>

<p>Exactly where the science of medicine ended, and the science of
witchcraft began, there is no means of knowing; like Astrology and
Astronomy, they were twin sisters, issuing from the same womb, and
travelling amicably hand in hand for many years down the trail of
civilization’s development; long after medicine had won for herself a
proud position in the world of thought and felt compelled through
shame to repudiate her less-favored comrade in public, the strictest
and closest relations were maintained in the seclusion of private life.</p>

<p>“Among the counter-charms too are reckoned the practice of spitting
into the urine the moment it is voided.”—(Pliny, lib, xxviii. cap. 7.)</p>

<p>“Goat’s dung attached to infants, in a piece of cloth, prevents them
from being restless, female infants in particular.” (Idem, cap. 78.)
This was probably a survival from times still more ancient, when infants
were sometimes suckled by goats, and it was a good plan to have
them thoroughly familiarized with the smell,—the hircine or caprine
odor.</p>

<p>“In cases of fire, if some of the dung can be brought away from the
stalls, both sheep and oxen may be got out all the more easily, and
will make no attempt to return.”—(Idem, cap. 81.)</p>

<p>The adepts in magic expressly forbid a person, when about to make
water, to uncover the body in the face of the sun or moon, or to
sprinkle with his urine the shadow of any object whatsoever. Hesiod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
gives a precept recommending persons to make water against an object
standing full before them, that no divinity may be offended by
their nakedness being uncovered. Osthanes maintains that every one
who drops some urine upon his foot in the morning will be proof
against all noxious medicaments.—(Idem, lib. xxviii. cap. 19.)</p>

<p>The adepts in the magical art also believed that “it is improper
to spit into the sea, or to profane that element by any other of the
evacuations that are inseparable from the infirmities of human nature.”—(Idem,
lib. xxx. cap. 6, speaking of the disinclination of the Armenian
magician, Tiridates, to visit the Emperor Nero by sea.)</p>

<p>The Thibetans share these scruples. Among the things prohibited
to their “Bhikshuni,” or monks and nuns, are: “Ne pas se soulager
dans de l’eau quand on n’est pas malade, n’y cracher, n’y moucher, y
vomir, ni y jeter quoi que soit de sale.”—(“Pratimoksha Sutra,” translated
by W. W. Rockhill, Paris, 1884, Soc. Asiatique.)</p>

<p>It was believed that a dog would not bark at a man who carried
hare’s dung about his person.—(See Pliny, lib. xxx. cap. 53.)</p>

<p>“The therionaca ... has the effect of striking wild beasts of all
kinds with a torpor which can only be dispelled by sprinkling them
with the urine of the hyena.” (Idem, lib. xxiv. cap. 102.) The hyena
was regarded as an especially “magical” animal.—(Idem, lib. xxviii.)</p>

<p>“The magicians tell us that, after taking the ashes of a wild-boar’s
genitals in urine, the patient must make water in a dog-kennel, and
repeat the following formula: ‘This I do that I may not wet my bed,
as a dog does.’”—(Idem, lib. xxviii. cap. 60.)</p>

<p>Some of these ideas would appear to have crossed the Atlantic. In
the United States, a generation or less ago, boys were wont to urinate
“criss-cross” for good luck, and were careful not to let any of their
urine fall on their own shadows.—(Col. F. A. Seelye, Anthropological
Society, and others, Washington, D. C.)</p>

<p>In Minden, Westphalia, Germany, boys will urinate criss-cross, and
say, “Kreuspissen, morgenstirbstein-Jude” (“Let us piss criss-cross,
a Jew will die to-morrow”).—(Personal letter from Dr. Franz Boas,
Clark University, Worcester, Mass.)</p>

<p>“Nor ever defile the currents of rivers flowing seaward, nor fountains,
but specially avoid it.”—(“Opera et Dies,” Rev. J. Banks, London,
1856, p. 115.)</p>

<p>“Sorcerers try to procure some of a man’s excrement, and put it in
his food in order to kill him.”—(“Muhongo,” a boy from Angola,
Africa, personal interview, interpretation by Rev. Mr. Chatelain.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span></p>

<p>“Muhongo” also said that to “add one’s urine, even unintentionally,
to the food of another bewitches that other, and does him grievous
harm.”</p>

<p>Democritus says of the stone “aspisatis:” “Patients should
wear it attached to the body with camel’s dung.” (Quoted in Pliny,
lib. xxvii. cap. 54.) The same book tells us that stones of this kind
were worn generally by gladiators, Milo of Crotona being mentioned
as one. What “aspisatis” was cannot be learned.</p>

<p>“Another thing universally acknowledged, and one which I am
ready to believe with the greatest pleasure, is the fact that if the door-posts
are only touched with the menstruous fluid, all spells of the
magicians will be neutralized.”—(Pliny, lib. xxviii. cap. 24.)</p>

<p>“Osthanes, who accompanied Xerxes, the Persian king, in his expedition
against Greece, ... the first person, so far as I can ascertain,
who wrote upon magic.” (Idem, lib. xxx. cap. 3.) He adds, speaking of
magic: “Britannia still cultivates this art, and that with ceremonials
so august that she might almost seem to have been the first to communicate
them to Persia.”—(Idem, lib. xxx. cap. 4.)</p>

<p>For the relief of infants from phantasm, wrap some goat-dung in a
cloth and hang it about the child’s neck. “Ad infantes qui fantasmatibus
vexantur, capræ stercus in panno involutum, et collo suspensum
remedium est infantibus qui fantasmata patiuntur.”—(Sextus Placitus,
“De Capro.”)</p>

<p>“With Plinius was contemporary Joseph or Josephus. The tales
about the mandrake, much later on, and found in the Saxon herbarium,
are traceable to what he says of the Baaras,—an herb that runs away
from the man that wants to gather it, and won’t stop until one throws
on it οὖρον γυναικὸς ἢ τὸ ἔμμηνον αἷμα, for nastiness is often an element
of mysteries; and even then it kills the dog that draws it out. It is
not certain that mandrake berries are meant in Genesis, xxx. 14.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 16.)</p>

<p>Dulaure says that the repute in which mandrake was held was due
to its resemblance to the human form, and to the lies told to the
superstitious about it, one being that “ils disent qu’il est engendré dessous
un gibet de l’urine d’un larron pendu.”—(“Des Différens Cultes,”
Paris, 1825, vol. ii. p. 255, footnote.)</p>

<p>“For a man haunted by apparitions work a drink of a white hound’s
thost or dung in bitter ley; wonderfully it healeth.” (“Saxon Leechdoms,”
vol. i. p. 365.) This same “thost,” or dung, was recommended
in the treatment of nits and other insects on children, for dropsy (internally),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
and to drive away the “Dwarves,” who were believed to have
seized upon the patient afflicted with convulsions.</p>

<p>“Doors of houses are smeared with cow-dung and nimba-leaves, as a
preservative from poisonous reptiles.”—(Moor’s “Hindu Pantheon,”
London, 1810, p. 23.)</p>

<p>“In some parts of Western Africa, when a man returns home after
a long absence, before he is allowed to visit his wife he must wash his
person with a particular fluid, and receive from the sorcerer a certain
mark on his forehead, in order to counteract any magic spell which a
stranger woman may have cast upon him in his absence, and which
might be communicated through him to the women of his village.”—(“The
Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 157.)</p>

<p>We are not informed what this “particular fluid” was, but enough
has been adduced concerning the African’s belief in the potency of
human urine in cases similar to the above to warrant the insertion at
this point.</p>

<p>“On returning from an attempted ascent of the great African
mountain, Kilimanjaro, which is believed by the neighboring tribes to
be tenanted by dangerous demons, Mr. New and his party, as soon as
they reached the borders of the inhabited country, were disenchanted
by the inhabitants, being sprinkled with ‘a professionally prepared
liquor, supposed to possess the potency of neutralizing evil influences,
and removing the spell of wicked spirits.’”—(Idem, vol. i. p. 151,
quoting Charles New, “Life, Wanderings, and Labors in Eastern
Africa.”)</p>

<p>That the Eskimo believed in the power of human ordure to baffle
witchcraft would seem to be intimated in the following from Boas:
“Though the Angekok understood the schemes of the old hag, he followed
the boy, and sat down with her. She feigned to be very glad to
see him and gave him a dishful of soup, which he began to eat. But
by the help of his tornaq [that is, the magical influence which aided
him] the food fell right through him into a vessel which he had put between
his feet on the floor of the hut. This he gave to the old witch,
and compelled her to eat it. She died as soon as she had brought the
first spoonful to her mouth.”—(“The Central Eskimo,” Franz Boas,
in “Sixth Annual Report” Bureau of Ethnology, Washington.)</p>

<p>“Osthanes, the magician, prescribed the dipping of our feet, in the
morning, in human urine, as a preventative against charms.”—(Brand,
“Pop. Ant.,” vol. iii. p. 286.)</p>

<p>Frommann writes that human ordure, menses, and semen were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
mixed in the food of the person to be bewitched.—(“Tractatus de
Fascinatione,” p. 683.)</p>

<p>On another page this list is increased to read that human ordure,
urine, blood, hair, nails, bones, skulls, and the moss growing on the
last-named, as well as animal excrement, were among the materials
employed in witchcraft.—(Idem, p. 684.)</p>

<p>If fried beans be thrown into excrement, for each bean thus wasted
a pustule will appear on the fundament of the thrower. “Pisa frixa
injecta excrementis tot pustulas in podice excitant quot pisa.”
(Idem, p. 1023.) The following passage is not fully understood:
“Vesicatorio excrementis adhuc calentibus imposito intestina corrosione
afficiuntur.” It seems to mean that the entrails will be affected
with corrosion when hot excrement is placed in a bladder, probably
after the manner of some of the sausages of which we have elsewhere
taken notes. Hot ashes or cinders thrown upon recently voided
excrement will cause inflammation and pustules in ano. For the same
reason we can cause those who are absent to purge without using
medicine upon them. “Cineres calidi, vel prunæ candentes scybalis
recentibus injecta inflammationem et pustulas in ano excitant....
Eadem ratione absentes sine medicamentis purgari posse, scribit Tilemannus
de Mater. Medic. p. 251. (Idem, p. 1623.) Frommann also
adds that this fact was well known to the English and French, as well
as to the Germans.”—(Idem, p. 1037.)</p>

<p>Human ordure and urine were burned with live coals as a potent
charm. The person whose excreta had been burned would suffer terrible
pains in the rectum. But this could be used in two ways,
for love as well as hatred could be induced by this means, between
married people and between old friends.—(Paullini, pp. 264, 265.)</p>

<p>For the use of urine by the Eskimo to ward off the maleficence of
witches, turn back to citations taken from Rink’s “Tales and Traditions
of the Eskimo,” where it is shown that they still use it with
this object in cases of childbirth. See, also, the notes taken from the
writings of Dr. Franz Boas.</p>

<p>A bone from the leg or thigh of a man who had died a violent
death, emptied of its marrow, and then filled with human ordure,
closed up with wax, and placed in boiling water, compelled the unfortunate
ejector of the excrement to evacuate just as long as the bone
was kept in the water, and it could even be so used that he would be
compelled to defile his bed every night. “Os ex pede, vel brachio, vel
femore hominis violenta morte interempti, et hoc exempta medulla<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
impletur cum stercore alicujus hominis, foramina obturantur cum cera
et sic in aquam calidam immittitur, hoc quamdiu jacet in aqua calida,
tamdiu expurgatur iste, cujus stercus fuit inclusum, adeo ut sic aliquem
usque ad mortem purgare possimus, potest etiam fieri alio modo
ut quis omni nocte lectum suum maculet, sed est ludicrum.”—(Etmuller,
vol. ii. pp. 272, 273.)</p>

<p>The small bones of the human leg are used in the sorcery of the
Australians. (See “Native Tribes of South Australia,” Adelaide,
1879, p. 276; received through the kindness of the Royal Society,
Sydney, New South Wales, F. B. Kyngdon, Secretary.)</p>

<p>“In order to produce a flux in the belly, it was only necessary to
put a patient’s excrement into a human bone, and throw it into a
stream of water.” The above is quoted from the medical writings of
“Peter of Spain, who was archbishop, and afterwards pope, under the
name of John XXI.”—(“Physicians of the Middle Ages,” T. C.
Minor, p. 6.)</p>

<p>Schurig names many authors to show that in cases of “incivility,”
such as the placing of excrement at the door of one’s neighbor, the
person offended had a sure remedy in his own hands. He was to take
some of the excrement of the offending party, mix it with live coals
or hot ashes, and throw it out in the street; or he could burn pepper
and wine together, with such fecal matter; or he could heat an iron
to white heat, insert it in the excrement, and as fast as it cooled
repeat the operation; as often as this was done, so often would the
guilty one suffer pains in the anus. Other remedies were, to mix
spirits of wine and salt together, sprinkle upon the offensive matter,
then place a red-hot iron above it, and confer the same pains, which
would not leave the offending person’s anus during the whole of that
day, unless he cured himself with new milk. Or small peas could be
heated in a frying-pan, and then thrown out with fresh excrement; as
many as there were peas, so many would be the pains endured by the
delinquent. The following are some of the paragraphs in the original
from Schurig: “Contra incivilitatem quorundam qui loca consueta et
fores aliorum stercoribus suis commaculant, pro correctione inservire
potest, si fimus eorundem simpliciter prunis aut cineribus calidis injectus
vel etiam vino adusto et pipere simul insperso uratur vel cremetur;
aut si vero vel aliud ferrum in ignem ut ignescat, immittatur,
ac dein ferrum illud candens in excrementa illa infigatur; frigefactum
denuom calefiat eademque opera sæpe repetatur; tunc tantis cruciatibus
nates depositoris illius incivilito vexabit, quantas vix prunæ ipsæ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
partibus iisdem admotæ inussissent.... Excrementis hominis recentibus
prunas candentes vel cineres calidos injectos inflammationem,
tenesimum, et pustulas excitare, non Anglis et Gallis tantum sed et
Germanis atque ex his nostratibus etiam est notissimum,” etc. The
names of the authorities cited by Schurig are not repeated.—(“Chylologia,”
pp. 790, 791.)</p>

<p>“The Australians believe that their magicians ‘possess the power’
to create disease and death by burning what is called ‘nahak.’
Nahak means rubbish, but principally, refuse of food. Everything of
the kind they bury or throw into the sea, lest the disease-makers
should get hold of it.” (“Native Tribes of South Australia,”
Adelaide, 1879, p. 23.) Reference to “Nahak” is to be found in
“Samoa,” Turner, p. 320.</p>

<p>The old home of the Cheyennes of Dakota was in the Black Hills;
and there the Sioux believed that the Cheyennes were invincible,
because their medicine-men could make everything out of buffalo
manure.—(Personal Notes of Captain Bourke.)</p>

<p>Although Livingston’s “Zambesi” is filled with allusions to witchcraft,
there is no instance given of the employment of any of the
remedies herein described.</p>

<p>“The belief in witchcraft, and in the efficacy of charms and incantations,
was strong among the middle and lower classes of Germany
about forty years ago.... In the winter of 1845-46, I attended a
night-school in my native town, Schorndorf, in the little kingdom of
Wurtemburg. There was a blacksmith-shop in the near neighborhood
of the school, where work was kept up until a late hour of the night.
The miniature fireworks created by the sparks flying from the blows of
the immense hammers wielded by the dusky and weird-like forms of the
sons of Vulcan, were one of the principal amusements of the schoolboys,
and we used to stand at a distance in the dark, before school opened,
gazing with awe and wonderment at the brilliant and noisy scene before
us. The master blacksmith, on account of his irascible disposition, was
not much in favor with us, and it was agreed upon to play him a trick.
So one evening while the smiths were at their supper and the smithy
unattended, two of the boys smeared the hammer-handles with excrement.
The indignation of the smiths was of course great, and with
curses and imprecations on the guilty parties they commenced to clean
their implements, when suddenly stopped by the master, who, with a
fiendish smile on his face, declared that he had concluded to make an
example of the offenders. He bade the apprentice to work at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
bellows, and then, one after the other, he held the smeared hammer-handles
over the forge fire, turning and twisting them the while, and
uttering some unintelligible incantations in a low and solemn voice,
the workmen standing round him with awe and terror on their sooty
countenances. When the ceremony was over, the master declared that
it was rather hard on the culprits, whose rectums must be in a frightful
condition, but that, unless an example were made, such dirty tricks
might be repeated, and this would serve as a warning to the boys in
general. We boys had been tremblingly watching the whole proceedings,
expecting that some fearful catastrophe would befall us, and
I need not state that we were somewhat disappointed when we found
ourselves unscathed, although it upset our belief in humbugs of this
kind.”—(Personal letter from Mr. Charles Smith, Washington,
D. C.)</p>

<p>“Amongst some of the Brazilian Indians, when a girl attains puberty,
... if she have a call of nature, a female relative takes the
girl on her back and carries her out, taking with her a live coal, to
prevent evil influences from entering the girl’s body.”—(“The Golden
Bough,” Frazer, vol. ii. p. 231.)</p>

<p>“To unbewitch the bewitched, you must spit into the pisse-pot
where you have made water.”—(Reg. Scot, “Disc. of Witchcraft,”
p. 62.)</p>

<p>“The Shamans of the Thlinkeets of Alaska keep their urine until
its smell is so strong that the spirits cannot endure it.”—(Franz
Boas, in “Journal of American Folk-Lore,” vol. i. p. 218.)</p>

<p>In the third volume of the “History of the Inquisition,” by Henry
C. Lea, New York, 1888, there is a chapter on “Sorcery and Occult
Arts,” but there is no allusion to the use of excrement in any form.
Neither is there anything to be found in Dalyell’s “Superstitions of
Scotland,” Edinburgh, 1834.</p>

<p>The sacred drink, “hum,” of the Parsis, has “the urine of a young,
pure cow” as one of the ingredients. (See Max Müller’s “Biographies
of Words,” London, 1888, p. 237.) This sacred drink is also used “as
an offering during incantations.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Schurig (“Chylologia,” p. 815) states that horse-dung was sometimes
used in “sympathetic magic:” “Interdum etiam ad Sympathiam
magicam adhibetur;” and he recites an instance wherein a certain
farmer, whose meadows were overrun by the horses of his neighbors,
was enabled by taking a portion of the dung they had dropped and
hanging it up in his chimney, to drive them all into a consumption.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
The following seems to have been in the nature of an incantation
closely allied to the above. “Two Yakut chiefs contended for supremacy;
one, named Onagai, defeated and banished his rival, who escaped
with only his wife and two mares. This second chief, Aley, collected
carefully the dung of his mares, and when the wind blew towards Onagai’s
dwelling, made fires of the dung, the smell of which allured the
strayed cattle to his dwelling.”—(Sauer, “Exped. to the N. parts of
Russia,” London, 1802, p. 133. This “Aley,” according to Tartar
tradition, was skilled in magic art. See idem, p. 135.)</p>

<p>“He who wishes to revenge himself by witchcraft endeavors to
procure either the saliva, urine, or excrements of his enemy, and after
mixing them with a powder, and putting them into a bag woven in a
particular form, he buries them.”—(Krusenstern’s “Voy. round the
World,” Eng. trans., London, 1813, vol. i. p. 174, speaking of the island
of Nukahiva.)</p>

<p>Langsdorff says that in the Washington islands, when a man desires
to bewitch an enemy, he endeavors to procure “some of his hair, the
remains of something he has been eating, and some earth on which he
has spit or made water.”—(“Voyages,” London, 1813, p. 156.)</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Ellis, speaking of the Tahitians, says: “The parings
of nails, a lock of the hair, the saliva from the mouth, or other secretions
from the body, or else a portion of the food which the person was
to eat, this was considered as the vehicle by which the demon entered
the person who afterwards became possessed.... The sorcerer
took the hair, saliva, or other substance, which had belonged to his
victim, to his house, or marae, performed his incantations over it, and
offered his prayers; the demon was then supposed to enter the substance
(called tubu), and through it to the individual who had suffered
from the enchantment.”—(“Polynesian Researches,” vol. ii. p. 228,
quoted in “The Nat. Trib. of S. Australia,” p. 25.)</p>

<p>“If the death of any obnoxious person is desired to be procured by
sorcery, the malevolent native secures a portion of his enemy’s hair,
refuse of food, or excrement; these substances are carried in a bag
specially reserved for the artillery of witchcraft, a little wallet which
is slung over the shoulders. The refuse of food is subjected to special
treatment, part of which is scorching and melting before a fire; but,
in the case of excrement, my information is to the effect that it is just
allowed to moulder away, and as it decays the health and strength of
the enemy is supposed to decline contemporaneously. Excrement is
thus employed in the south of Queensland.”—(Personal letter from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
John Matthew, Esq., M. A., dated “The Manse,” Coburg, Victoria,
Nov. 29, 1889. This correspondent has had a great deal of experience
with the savages of Australia.)</p>

<p>The Patagonians have the belief that their witches can do harm to
those from whom they obtain any exuviæ or excrement,—“if they can
possess themselves of some part of their intended victim’s body, or
that which has proceeded from it, such as hair, pieces of nails, etc.;
and this superstition is the more curious from its exact accordance
with that so prevalent in Polynesia.”—(“Voyage of the Adventure
and Beagle,” quoting the Jesuit Falkner, vol. ii. p. 163.)</p>

<p>There was some ill-defined relation between the power of urination
and virginity. Burton speaks of “such strange, absurd trials in Albertus
Magnus ... by stones, perfumes, to make them piss and
confess I know not what in their sleep.”—(“Anat. of Melancholy,”
vol. ii. p. 451.)</p>

<p>Speaking of the Australians, Smith says: “The only remarkable
custom (differing from other savages) in their fighting expeditions, is
the adoption of the custom commanded to the Israelites on going out
to war. (Deut. c. 23, ver. 12-14,—about hiding excrement.) The
natives believe that if the enemy discovered it, they would burn it in
the fire, and thus ensure their collective destruction, or that, individually,
they would pine away and die.”—(“Aborigines of Victoria,”
vol. i. p. 165.)</p>

<p>“In the middle of the hall ... was a vase, of which the contents
were at least as varied as those of the caldron of Macbeth; a mixture,
in part, composed of nameless ingredients.”—(“Dictionnaire Universel
du XIXme Siècle,” by P. Larousse, quoted in “Reports of Voudoo
Worship in Hayti and Louisiana,” by W. W. Newell, in “Jour. of
Amer. Folk-Lore,” Jan.-March, 1889, p. 43.)</p>

<p>There is on record the confession of a young French witch, Jeanne
Bosdean, at Bordeaux, 1594, wherein is described a witches’ mass, at
which the devil appeared in the disguise of a black buck, with a candle
between his horns. When holy water was needed, the buck urinated
in a hole in the ground and the officiating witch aspersed it upon
the congregation with a black sprinkler. Jeanne Bosdean adhered to
her story even when in the flames.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>One of the ceremonies of the initiation of the neophytes into witchcraft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
was “kissing the devil’s bare buttocks.” (Reg. Scot. “Discoverie,”
pp. 36, 37.) Pope Gregory IX., in a letter addressed to several
German bishops in 1234, describes the initiation of sorcerers as follows:
The novices, on being introduced into the assembly, “see a toad of
enormous size.... Some kiss its mouth, others its rear.” Next,
“a black cat is presented.... The novice kisses the rear anatomy of
the cat, after which he salutes in a similar manner those who preside
at the feast, and others worthy of the honor.” (“Med. in Middle
Ages,” Minor, p. 41.) Again, “At witches’ reunions, the possessed
kissed the devil’s rear, kissing it goat fashion, in a butting attitude.”
(Idem, p. 50.) “Le baiser d’hommage est donné au derrière du
Diable parce qu’il n’a été permis à Moïse, selon l’Exode, de voir que le
derrière de Dieu.”—(Mélusine, Paris, July-August, 1890, p. 90, art.
“La Fascination,” by J. Tuchmann.)</p>

<p>The devil hates nothing more than human ordure. (On this point,
see Luther’s Table Talk.) The devil cannot be more completely frustrated
than by placing upon some of his works human ordure, or hanging
it in the smoke of the chimney. The Laplanders were reputed to
be able to detain a ship in full sail; yet when such a vessel had been
besmeared along its seams in the interior with the ordure of virgins,
then the efforts of the witches were of no avail. (Paullini, p. 260.)
“A certain man bewitched a boy, nine years old, by placing the boy’s
ordure in a hog’s bladder and hanging the ‘sausage’ in the chimney.
(Idem, p. 261.) But some believed that by this smoking of ordure
the evil often became worse; that the diseased person gradually dried
up until at last he died, as he experienced in the case of his own
father-in-law.... Farmers’ wives, to make the butter come in spite
of the witches, poured fresh cow’s milk upon human ordure, or down
into the privy, and the witches were thereupon rendered powerless.”—(Idem,
p. 263. See also citation from Schurig, “Chylologia.”)</p>

<p>The Magi also taught to drink the ashes of a pig’s pizzle in sweet
wine, and so to make water into a dog’s kennel, adding the words,
“Lest he, like a hound, should make urine in his own bed.” If a man,
in the morning, made water a little on his own foot, it would be a preservative
against mala medicamenta, doses meant to do him harm.—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” lib. i. p. 12, quoting Pliny. See citations already
made from that author.)</p>

<p>Beckherius (Med. Microcosmus, p. 114) tells the story of the Lapland
witches being able to hold a ship in its course, except when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
inner seams of the vessel had been calked with the ordure of a virgin;
see extract already entered.</p>

<p>Again, Beckherius quotes Josephus as narrating that a certain lake,
near Jericho, ejected asphalt which adhered so tenaciously to a ship
that it was in danger of wreck, had not the asphalt been loosened by
an application of menstrual blood and human urine.—(Idem, p. 43,
quoting Josephus, “De Bello Judaico,” lib. iv. c. 47.)</p>

<p>Beckherius, “Med. Microcosmus,” p. 43, cites Josephus in regard to
a certain plant to which magical properties were ascribed, but only to
be brought out by watering it with menstrual blood and the urine of a
woman.—(Josephus, “De Bell. Jud.” lib. vii. c. 23, p. 146.)</p>

<p>Dittmar Bleekens, speaking of the “Islanders” (Icelanders), says:
“And truly, it is a wonder that Satan so sporteth with them, for hee
hath shewed them a remedie in staying of their ships, to wit, the excrements
of a maide being a Virgin; if they anoynt the Prow and certaine
plancks of the ship hee hath taught them that the spirit is put
to flight and driven away with this stinke.”—(In Purchas, vol. i. p.
646.)</p>

<p>Josephus says (his remarks have already been given in quotation,
but are repeated to show exactly what he did say): The bitumen of
Lake Asphaltites “is so tenacious as to make the ship hang upon the
clods till they set it loose with blood and with urine, to which alone it
yields.”—(“Wars of the Jews,” Eng. trans., New York, 1821, book 4,
c. 7.)</p>

<p>The people of the Island of Mota, or Banks Island, “have a kind of
individual totem, called tamaniu. It is some object, generally an
animal, as a lizard or snake, but sometimes a stone, with which the
person imagines that his life is bound up; if it dies or is broken or
lost, he will die. Fancy dictates the choice of a tamaniu; or it may
be found by drinking an infusion of certain kinds of herbs and heaping
together the dregs. Whatever living thing is first seen in or upon
the heap is the tamaniu. It is watched, but not fed or worshipped.”—(Frazer,
“Totemism,” Edinburgh, 1887, p. 56.)</p>

<p>Compare the preceding paragraph with the practice, elsewhere noted,
of determining whether or not a woman is pregnant by pouring some
of her urine upon bran and allowing it to ferment and then watching
the appearance of animal life. Also, the method of determining whether
or not a man was stricken with leprosy.</p>

<p>To determine whether a woman be pregnant of a boy or a girl,
make two small holes in the ground; in one, put wheat; in the other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
barley; let her urinate on both; if the wheat sprout first, she will
have a boy; if the barley, a girl. To determine whether a man had
been attacked by leprosy (elephantiasis), the ashes of burnt lead
(plumbi usti cineres) were thrown into his urine; if they fell to the
bottom, he was well; if they floated on top, he was in danger.</p>

<p>To tell whether a man had been bewitched, “Coque in olla nova, ad
ignem, urinam hominis quæ si ebullierit, liber erit a veneficio.”—(Beckherius,
“Med. Microcosmus,” pp. 61, 62.)</p>

<p>To determine whether a sick man was to die during the current
month, some of his urine was shaken up in a glass vessel until it
foamed; then the observer took some of his own earwax (cerumen)
and placed it in this foam; if it separated, the man was to recover; if
not, not.—(Idem, p. 62.)</p>

<p>“It is said that King Louis Philippe before mounting on horseback
never failed to urinate against the left hind leg of his horse, according
to an old tradition in cavalry that such a proceeding had the effect of
strengthening the leg of the beast and rendering the animal more apt
to sustain the effort made by the rider when jumping upon the
saddle. I tell you the fact as I heard it reported by one of the king’s
sons, Prince of Joinville, forty-five years ago when I was sailing in a
frigate—‘La Belle Poule’—under his command.”—(Personal letter
from Captain Henri Jouan, French Navy.)</p>

<p>The people of Lake Ubidjwi, near Lake Tanganyika, are thus described:
“Both sexes of all classes carry little carved images round
their necks or tied to the upper part of their arms as a charm against
evil spirits. They are usually hollow, and filled with filth by the
medicine-men.”—(“Across Africa,” Cameron, London, 1877, vol. i.
p. 336.)</p>

<p>In the incantations made by the medicine-men to avert disaster from
fire and preserve his expedition, Cameron notes, among other features,
“a ball made of shreds of bark, mud, and filth.” (Idem, vol. ii.
p. 118.) The term “filth,” as here employed, can have but one
meaning.</p>

<p>“Poor Robin, in his Almanac for 1695 ... ridicules the following
indelicate fooleries then in use, which must surely have been either of
Dutch or Flemish extraction. They who when they make water go
streaking the walls with their urine, as if they were planning some

two or three admonitions, as incurable fools.” (Brand, “Popular
Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 175, article “Nose and Mouth Omens.”) This
was possibly a survival from some old method of divining.</p>

<p>Cameron, describing the dance of a medicine-man in the village of
Kwinhata, near the head of the Congo, and the humble deference
shown to these Mganga by the women, says of one of the women:
“She soon went away quite happy, the chief Mganga having honored her
by spitting in her face and giving her a ball of beastliness as a charm.
This she hastened to place in safety in her hut.”—(“Across Africa,”
vol. ii. p. 82.)</p>

<p>An article in “Table Talk,” copied in the “Evening Star,” Washington,
D. C., of Dec. 17, 1888, entitled “Christmas under the Polar
Star,” says that “in Southern Lapland, should the householder neglect
to provide an ample store of fuel for the season’s needs, in popular belief,
the disgusted Yule-swains or Christmas goblins would so befoul
the wood-pile that there would be no getting at its contents.”</p>

<p>Frommann devotes a long article to a refutation of the popular idea
of his day that from the urine or seed of a man innocently hanged for
theft, could be generated “homunculi.” “Anile istud placitum, ex
urina vel semine hominis innocenter ad suspendium furti crimine
damnati homunculum generari.”—(“Tract. de Fascinat.,” p. 672.)</p>

<p>“Butler’s description in his ‘Hudibras’ of ‘a cunning man or fortune-teller,’
is fraught with a great deal of his usual pleasantry,—</p>

<p>“There were Etruscan wizards who made rain or discovered springs
of water, it is not certain which. They were thought to bring the
rain or water out of their bellies.”—(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer,
vol. i. p. 22.)</p>

<p>The bed-chamber of Munza, King of the Mombottoes, was “painted
with many geometrical designs ... the white from dog’s dung (album
Græcum).”—(“Heart of Africa,” Schweinfurth, London, 1878, vol. ii.
p. 36.)</p>

<p>It is quite safe to assert that these “geometrical designs” were
“magical.”</p>

<p>“Witches are supposed to acquire influence over any one by becoming
possessed of anything belonging to the intended victim,—such
as a hair, a piece of wearing apparel, or a pin. The influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
acquired by the witch is greater if such an article be voluntarily or
unconsciously handed to her by the person asked for it.... A
witch can be disabled by securing a hair of her head, wrapping it in a
piece of paper, and placing it against a tree as a target into which a
silver bullet is to be fired from a gun.... When the patient reaches
the age of adolescence, the alleged relief (from incontinence of urine)
is obtained by urinating into a newly-made grave; the corpse must be
of the opposite sex to that of the experimenter.”—(“Folk-Lore of the
Pennsylvania Germans,” Hoffman, in “Journal of American Folk-Lore,”
January-March, 1889, pp. 28-32.)</p>

<p>Black alludes to the same ideas. See his “Folk-Medicine,” p. 16.</p>

<p>To frustrate the effects of witchcraft, Dr. Rosinus Lentilius recommended
that the patient take a quantity of his own ordure, the size
of a filbert, and drink it in oil. (See “Ephem. Medic.,” Leipsig, 1694,
p. 170.) According to Paullini, the antidotes were to take human
ordure both internally and externally, and human urine externally.
Schurig, for the same purpose, recommended the human urine and
ordure, but both to be taken internally, mixed with hyoscyamus.—(“Chylologia,”
pp. 765, 766.)</p>

<p>In France witches were transformed into animals, and vice versa,
“by washing their hands in a certain water which they kept in a pot.”
Reference is also made to “a basin of anything but holy water with
which the initiated were sprinkled.”—(“Sorcery and Magic,” Thomas
Wright, London, 1851, vol. i. pp. 310, 311, 328, 329.)</p>

<p>Reginald Scot tells the story of “a mass-priest” who was tormented
by an incubus; after all other remedies had failed, he was advised by
“a cunning witch ... that the next morning, about the dawning of
the day, I should pisse, and immediately should cover the pisse-pot, or
stop it with my right nether-stock.”—(“Discoverie,” p. 65.)</p>

<p>The Thlinkeet of the northwest coast of America believe that a
drowned man can be restored to life by cutting his skin and applying
a medicine made of certain roots infused in the urine of a child,
which has been kept for three moons. Drowned men, according to
their medicine-men, are turned into otters.—(See Franz Boas, in
“Journal of American Folk-Lore,” vol. i. p. 218.)</p>

<p>“It was a supposed remedy against witchcraft to put some of the
bewitched person’s water, with a quantity of pins, needles, and nails,
into a bottle, cork them up, and set them before the fire, in order to
confine the spirit; but this sometimes did not prove sufficient, as it
would often force the cork out with a loud noise, like that of a pistol,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
and cast the contents to a considerable height.”—(Brand, “Popular
Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 13, article “Sorcerers.”)</p>

<p>Where the limbs of a man had been bewitched, he should bathe
them with his own urine; some recommended an addition of garlic or
assafœtida.—(Frommann, “Tract. de Fascinat.,” pp. 961, 962.)</p>

<p>“Jorden, in his curious treatise, ‘Of the Suffocation of the Mother,’
1603, p. 24, says: ‘Another policie Marcellus Donatus tells us of,
which a physitian used toward the Countesse of Mantua, who, being in
that disease which we call melancholia hypochondriaca, did verily believe
that she was bewitched, and was cured by conveying of nayles,
needles, feathers, and such like things, into her close-stool when she took
physicke, making her believe that they came out of her bodie.’”—(Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 13, article “Sorcerers.”)</p>

<p>Schurig prescribed hen and dove dung for the cure of the bewitched.—(“Chylologia,”
p. 817.)</p>

<p>Beckherius highly extolled human ordure for the same purpose.—(“Med.
Microcosmus,” p. 113.)</p>

<p>“The catamenial blood of women was looked upon as efficacious in
chasing away demons.”—(Black, “Folk-Medicine,” p. 154, quoting
Sinistrari.)</p>

<p>In Scotland, “they put a small quantity of salt into the first milk
of a cow, after calving, that is given to any person to drink. This is
done with a view to prevent skaith (harm), if it should happen that
the person is not canny.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” vol. iii. p. 165, art.
“Salt-Falling.” Compare the foregoing with what Sir Samuel Baker
tells us about African superstitions on the same subject.)</p>

<p>“On line 160, Reinerstein’s and Retz’s edition of Lucian’s ‘Dea
Syra,’ 4vo, vol. iii. p. 654, you will find human dung mentioned as
a medicine or charm, and urine some lines lower.”—(Personal letter
from Prof. W. Robertson Smith, dated Christ College, Cambridge,
England, August 11, 1888.)</p>

<p>One of the most curious features about Grimm’s “Teutonic Mythology”
(Stallybrass’ translation, London, 1882), is the absence of any
mention of the use of human or animal ordure or urine in any manner,
either medicinally or religiously, or to baffle witchcraft. He may
have issued a supplement, in which all this may have been corrected;
but if he did not, then his work is most singularly defective.</p>

<p>Mr. Sylvester Baxter states that in a recent conversation with Mr.
Frank H. Cushing, near Tempe, Arizona, he learned that in Mr.
Cushing’s youth, people in Central and Western New York were still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
using charms against witchcraft, and that Mr. Cushing was personally
acquainted with a family which had prepared a decoction, one of
whose ingredients was human urine; this as a preventive of witchcraft.
The locality referred to was about eighteen miles from Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<p>“Spitting into recently voided urine prevents one from getting
‘warrle’ on his eyes.” (Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen, Cambridge, Mass.)
This remedy goes back to Pliny.</p>

<p>“To unbewitch the bewitched, you must spit in the pot where you
have made water.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” vol. iii. p. 263, art.
“Saliva,” quoting from Reginald Scot’s “Discoverie.”)</p>

<p>“Several fetid and stinking matters, such as old urine, are excellent
means for keeping away all kinds of evil-intentioned spirits and
ghosts.”—(Rink, “Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo,” Edinburgh,
1875, pp. 50, 452.)</p>

<p>“The Manxmen still place a vessel full of water outside their doors
at night, to enable the fairies (who, they say, were the first inhabitants
of their island,) to wash themselves, and prevent them from
doing harm.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.” vol. ii. p. 494, art. “Fairy
Mythology.”)</p>

<p>It is certainly singular to find here a trace of the custom noted as
existing among the Laplanders and the people of Siberia, who placed
tubs of urine for the same purpose, urine being used in ordinary
ablutions.</p>

<p>In England, there was a superstition that the woman who made
water upon nettles would be “peevish for a whole day.”—(Brand,
“Pop. Ant.,” vol. iii. p. 359, art. “Divination by Flowers.”)</p>

<p>Fosbroke (“Encyclopædia of Antiquities,” vol. ii.) says that this
proverb is ancient. “Nettles were in ancient times regarded as an
aphrodisiac.”</p>

<p>Schurig (“Chylologia,” p. 795) repeats the story to the effect that
the Laplanders calked the inner seams of their ships with the ordure
of virgins to increase their speed. The Laplanders, when any of their
reindeer die of disease, abandon their camp, being careful “to burn
all the excrement of the animal before they depart.”—(Leem’s
“Account of Danish Lapland,” in Pinkerton, vol. i. p. 484. See previous
citations from Sauer in regard to the Yakuts of Siberia.)</p>

<p>The story was current in California, about twenty years since, that
the immigrants to that state from Missouri and Arkansas, in the gold-mining
days, had the custom of depositing their evacuations, before
starting on the march of the day, in the camp-fires of the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
night. Nothing was learned of the meaning, if any, of the custom.
Nursing women sprinkled a few drops of their milk on the burning
coals in the fireplace, to ensure an abundant flow.—(Etmuller,
vol. i. p. 68.)</p>

<p>The author has been fortunate in obtaining a copy of the address of
Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, D. C.,
upon the “Medical Mythology of Ireland.”</p>

<p>This interesting and extremely valuable contribution, which can be
found in the “Transactions of the American Philosophical Society for
1887,” leaves no uncertainty in regard to the mystic powers ascribed
by the Celtic peasantry to both urine and ordure. Urine and chicken-dung
are shown to be potent in frustrating the mischief of fairies;
“fire, iron, and dung” are spoken of as the “three great safeguards
against the influence of fairies and the infernal spirits.” Dung is
carried about the person, as part of the contents of amulets; and children
suffering from convulsions are, as a last resort, bathed from head
to foot in urine, to rescue them from the clutches of their fairy
persecutors. See also p. 377, in regard to the “dwarves,” who, in
England, seem to be the same as fairies.</p>

<p>Du Chaillu, in his “Land of the Midnight Sun,” makes no reference
to the use, in any manner, by the inhabitants of that region, of excrementitious
materials for any purposes. His stay was of such an extremely
short duration, that his observations cannot be compared with
those made by Leems and others, from whom information has already
been extracted.</p>

<p>A curious survival, in France, of the Parsi custom of the “Nirang”
is demonstrated in the May number of “Mélusine,” Paris, 1888,
entitled “Le Nirang des Parsis, en Basse Bretagne.”</p>

<p>“J’ai passé mon enfance, jusqu’à l’âge de quatorze ans, dans un
vieux manoir breton, du nom de Keramborgne, dans la commune de
Plouarte, arrondissement de Lannion. Le manoir paternel était bien
connu des malheureux et des mendiants errants ... qui venaient
demander le vivre et le couvert pour la nuit.... Parmi les pauvres
errants qui étaient les hôtes les plus assidus de Keramborgne ...
se trouvait une vieille femme nommée Gillette Kerlohiou, qui connaissait
toutes les nouvelles du pays ... et, de plus, avait la réputation
d’être quelque peu sorcière, et de guérir certaines maladies par
des oraisons et des herbes dont elle seule avait le secret.... Un
matin que Gillette avait passé la nuit à l’étable ... elle marmottait
des prières.... Une vache s’étant mise à uriner, la vieille mendiante<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
se précipita vers elle, reçut de l’urine dans le creux de sa main et s’en
frotta la figure à plusieurs reprises.... Ce que voyant le vacher, il la
traita de salope et de vieille folle. Mais Gillette lui dit, sans s’émouvoir:
‘Rien n’est meilleur, mon fils, que de se laver la figure, le matin,
en se levant, avec de l’urine de la vache, et même avec sa propre urine
si l’on ne peut se procurer de celle de vache. Quand vous avez fait
cette ablution, le matin, vous êtes, pour toute la journée, à l’abri des
embûches et des méchancetés du diable, car vous devenez invisible
pour lui.’”</p>

<p>The writer of the above, M. F.-M. Luzel, learned from the other
peasants and beggars standing about that the belief expressed by the
old woman was fully concurred in by her comrades.</p>

<p>“Nos paysannes de France se lavaient les mains dans leur urine ou
dans celle de leurs maris, ou de leurs enfants, pour détourner les maléfices
ou en empêcher l’effet.”—(Réclus, “Les Primitifs,” p. 98.)</p>

<p>Father Le Jeune must have been on the track of something corresponding
to an ur-orgy among the Hurons when he learned that the
devil imposed upon the sick, in dreams, the duty of wallowing in ordure
if they hoped for restoration to health.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>This penitential wallowing was retained by nations of a high order
of advancement, the ordure of primitive times being generally superseded
by clay and other less filthy matter.</p>

<p>“Let it suffice to display the points where Greek found itself in harmony
with Australian and American and African practice.... 3. The
habit of daubing persons about to be initiated with clay, ... or anything
else that is sordid, and of washing this off, apparently by way of
showing that old guilt is removed, and a new life entered upon.”—(“Myth,
Ritual, and Religion,” Andrew Lang, London, 1887, vol. ii.
p. 282.)</p>

<p>“Plutarch, in his essay on superstition, represents the guilty man
who would be purified actually rolling in clay.”—(Idem, p. 286.)</p>

<p>The following is described as the Abyssinian method of exorcising a
woman: The exorcist “lays an amulet on the patient’s heaving bosom,
makes her smell of some vile compound, and the moment her madness
is somewhat abated begins a dialogue with the Bouda (demon), who
answers in a woman’s voice. The devil is invited to come out in the
name of all the saints; but a threat to treat him with some red-hot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
coals is usually more potent, and after he has promised to obey, he
seeks to delay his exit by asking for something to eat. <i>Filth and dirt</i>
are mixed and hidden under a bush, when the woman crawls to the
sickening repast and gulps it down with avidity.”—(From an article
entitled “Abyssinian Women,” in the “Evening Star,” Washington,
D. C., October 17, 1885.)</p>

<p>“A Pretty Charme or Conclusion for one Possessed.... The possessed
body must go upon his or her knees to church, ... and so
must creep without going out of the way, being the common highway,
in that sort how foul and dirty soever the same may be, or whatsoever
lie in the way, not shunning anything whatsoever, untill he come to
the church, where he must heare masse devoutly.”—(Scot, “Discoverie,”
p. 178.)</p>

<p>By the Irish peasantry urine was sprinkled upon sick children.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>American boys urinate upon their legs to prevent cramp while
swimming.</p>

<p>In Stirling, Scotland, “a certain quantity of cow-dung is forced into
the mouth of a calf immediately after it is calved, or at least before it
has received any meat; owing to this, the vulgar believe that witches
and fairies can have no power ever after to injure the calf.”—(Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 257, article “Rural Charms.”)</p>

<p>Frommann gives a preparation of twenty-five ingredients for freeing
infants from witchcraft (fascinatio); but neither human nor animal

<p>Cox, in his history of Ireland, gives a description of the trial of
Lady Alice Kettle, of Ossory, charged with being a witch, and with
sacrificing to a familiar spirit at night, at cross-roads, nine red cocks
and nine peacock’s eyes, and with sweeping the streets of Kilkenny,
“raking all the filth towards the doors of her son, William Outlaw,
murmuring and muttering secretly with herself these words:—</p>

<p>This story is quoted by Vallencey, “Collect. de Rebus Hibernicis,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
Dublin, 1774, vol. ii. p. 369, and by Henry C. Lea, “History of the

found in Camden.</p>

<p>In the Island of Guernsey, within the present generation, “John
Lane, of Anneville, Lane Parish,” has been tried on the charge of
“having practised necromancy,” and “induced many persons in the
country parishes to believe that they were bewitched,” and that he
could drive away the devil and other bad spirits “by boiling herbs to
produce a certain perfume not at all grateful to the olfactory nerves of
demons, ... and the sprinkling of celestial water.”—(Brand, “Popular
Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 66, article “Sorcerers.”)</p>

<p>In the valuable compilation of superstitious practices interdicted by
Roman Catholic councils Thiers includes the persons who bathe their
hands with urine in the morning to avert witchcraft or nullify its
effect. He says, too, that Saint Lucy was reputed to be a witch, for
which reason the Roman Judge, Paschasius, at her trial sprinkled her
with urine.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>See the extract just quoted from “Mélusine.”</p>

<p>The Romans had a feast to the mother of all the gods, Berecinthia,
in which the matrons took their idol and sprinkled it with their urine.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Berecinthia was one of the names under which Cybele or Rhea, the
primal earth goddess, was worshipped by the Romans and by many
nations in the East. Her priests, the Galli, emasculated themselves
in orgies whose frenzy was of the same general type as the Omophagi
of the Greeks, previously described.</p>

<p>The emasculation of the priests of Cybele was performed with a
piece of Samian pottery.—(See footnote to Rev. Lewis Evans’ translation
of the Satires of Lucilius, lib. vii., edition of New York, 1860.)</p>

<p>The priests of Cybele were by some supposed to have received the
name of Galli from the River Gallus, “near which these priests inflicted
upon themselves the punishment we are speaking of.... The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
effect of the water of that river was to throw them into fits of enthusiasm,—‘qui
bibit, inde furit,’ as Ovid has it.”—(Abbé Banier, “Mythology,”
English translation, London, 1740, vol. ii. p. 563.)</p>

<p>“Here they set down their litters at night and bedew the very
image of the goddess with copious irrigations, while the chaste moon
witnesses their abominations.”—(Juvenal, Sixth Satire, describing the
rites of Bona Dea, translated by Rev. Lewis Evans, M.A., Wadhams
College, Oxford, New York, 1860.)</p>

<p>Father Baudin speaks of the secret society called the “Ogbuni:”
“From what I have been able to learn, this society is simply an institution
similar to the secret societies of the pagan people of ancient
times, where the members were initiated into the infamous mysteries
of the great goddess.” (Negroes of Guinea.)—(“Fetichism and
Fetich-worshippers,” Baudin, New York, 1885, p. 64.)</p>

<p>The Eskimo living near Point Barrow have a yearly ceremony for
driving out an evil spirit which they call Tuna. Among the ceremonies
incident to the occasion is this: One of the performers
“brought a vessel of urine and flung it on the fire.”—(“The Golden
Bough,” Frazer, vol. ii. p. 164, quoting “Report of the International
Polar Expedition to Point Barrow,” Washington, 1885, p. 42.)</p>

<p>It is strange to encounter in races so diverse apparently as the
Greeks and the Hottentots the same rites of emasculation and urine
sprinkling.</p>

<p>The sect of the “Skoptsi” or the “Eunuchs,” in Russia, “base their
peculiar tenets on Christ’s saying, ‘There are some eunuchs which
were born so from their mother’s womb, and there are some eunuchs
which were made eunuchs of men, and there be eunuchs which have
made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that
is able to receive it let him receive it’ (Matt. xix. 12).”—(Heard,
“Russian Creed and Russian Dissent,” p. 265.)</p>

<p>“This heresy, which is the most modern of all, probably owes its
origin to influences from the East slowly filtering through the lower
ranks of the population.”—(Idem, p. 267.)</p>

<p>Reginald Scot tells the story of a quack who preyed upon the fears
of patients suffering from tympanitis, telling them they had vipers in
their bellies, which vipers he would try to smuggle into the patient’s
“ordure or excrement, after his purgations.”—(“Discoverie,”
p. 198.)</p>

<p>Schurig relates that the countrywomen in Germany, if after milking
their cows for a long time they were unable to bring the proper quantity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
of butter, suspected that they were under the spell of a witch; to undo
this spell it was only necessary to mix some fresh milk with human
ordure and throw the mixture down the privy; or human ordure was
applied to the teats of the cows, much as Sir Samuel Baker has shown
the Africans will do in our day. “Quippe quæ, siquando in conficiendo
butyro, per tempus frustra laborarunt, suspicione veneficii
cujusdam seductæ lac vaccinum recens emulsum stercori humano
commixtum cloacæ simul infundunt, atque sic illico a Veneficio liberantur....
Si ferrum ignitum una stercore humano lacte vaccino consperso
inseras, veneficæ pustulas inducet.... Contra magicam lactis
vaccarum ablationem, ipsarum ubera stercore humano aliquamdiu
inungi solent.” And he ends his paragraph by quoting the dictum
of Johannis Michaelis, “Sine omni fascinatione et superstitione proprio
stercore efficere possit.”—(Schurig, “Chylologia,” pp. 788, 789, par.
62.)</p>

<p>Compare with the information derived from Paullini.</p>

<p>The above practice seems to have been transplanted to Pennsylvania,
with its more objectionable features omitted.</p>

<p>“The housewife sometimes finds difficulty in butter-making, the
spell being believed to be the work of a witch.... The remedy was
to plunge a red-hot poker into the contents of the churn, when the
spell was broken, and the butter immediately began to form.”—(“Folk-Lore
of the Penn’a Germans.”)—(Hoffman, in “Jour. of Amer.
Folk-Lore,” 1889.)</p>

<p>From all this it would appear plausible to assume that the “ripening
of cheese” in human urine was originally induced by a desire to
avert the evils of witchcraft. Refer also to the notes from Sir Samuel
Baker.</p>

<p>In “South Mountain Magic,” Mrs. M. V. Dahlgren, Boston, Mass.,
1882, may be found references to the bewitching of milk and cream,
and to the remedy employed of putting in hot stones or “a wedge of
hot iron” (pp. 165-167). In this partial “survival,” we see the disappearance
of the more objectionable features of the practices of the old
country. Mrs. Dahlgren’s book treats of the superstitions of the
Pennsylvania Germans living close to the Maryland border.</p>

<p>“The urine casters, a set of quacks almost within our own recollection,
had a peculiar jargon, which it is not necessary to attend to.”—(“Medical
Dictionary,” Bartholomew Parr, M. D., Philadelphia, Penn’a,
1819, art. “Urine.”)</p>

<p>When cattle had been killed by witchcraft, Reginald Scot gave a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
formula for detecting the culprit; among other things, the farmer was
directed to “traile the bowels of the beast unto your house ... into
the kitchen, and there make a fire, and set ouer the same a grediron,
and thereupon lay the inwards or bowels, and as they wax hot, so shall
the witches’ entrails be molested with extreme heat and pain.”—(“Discoverie,”
p. 198. It should be observed that there are no directions
about “cleaning” the bowels of the animal.)</p>

<p>Among the modes of detecting witches in England, were “by shaving
off every hair of the witch’s body. They were also detected by putting
hair, parings of the nails, and urine of any person bewitched into
a stone bottle, and hanging it up in the chimney.”—(Cotta, in his
“Short Discovery of the Unobserved Dangers,” p. 54, speaks of “the
burning of the dung or urine of such as are bewitched.”) In “A
Pleasant Grove of New Fancies,” by H. R. 8vo, London, 1857, p. 76,
we have:—</p>

<p>Among other methods given for baffling witches and making their
evil deeds turn upon themselves, we find: “taking some of the thatch
from over the door; or a tyle, if the house be tyled ... sprinkle it
over with the patient’s water.... Put salt into the patient’s water
and dash it upon the red hot tyle.” Another: heat a horse-shoe red hot
and “quench him in the patient’s urine.... Having the patient’s
urine, set it over the fire.... Put into it three horse-nails and a
little salt.... Or, heat a horse-shoe red hot” and “quench him several
times in the urine.” Still another: “stop the urine of the patient
close up in a bottle, and put into it three nails, pins, or needles, with a
little white salt, keeping the urine always warm.”—(Brand, “Pop.
Ant.” vol. iii. pp. 170 <i>et seq.</i>, art. “Sorcery and Witchcraft.”)</p>

<p>“To ascertain if one be bewitched, take his urine and boil it in a
new, unused pot; if it foam up, he is not bewitched; if not, it is uncertain.
Or, take clean ashes, put them in a new pot, let the patient
urinate thereon. Tie up the pot, and let it stand in the sun; then
break the ashes apart; if the person be bewitched, hairs will be found
therein.”—(Paullini, pp. 260, 261.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span></p>

<p>“Neither can I belieue (I speak it with reuerence unto graue judgments)
that ... the burning of the dung or vrine of such as are bewitched,
or floating bodies aboue the water, or the like, are any trial of
a witch.”—(“A Short Discouerie of the Unobserued Dangers of
Seuerall sorts of Ignorant and Vnconsiderate Practisers of Physicke
in England,” John Cotta, London, 1612, p. 54.)</p>

<p>Beckherius inclined to believe that human teeth, taken medicinally,
would break down witchcraft: “Contra maleficia et veneficia prodesse
scribit.”—(“Med. Microcosmus,” p. 265.)</p>

<p>“On New Year’s Day they (the Highlanders) burn juniper before
their cattle, and on the first Monday in every quarter, sprinkle them
with urine.”—(“Pennant’s Tour in Scotland,” in Pinkerton, vol. iii.
p. 90.)</p>

<p>“Les rustres slaves secouaient sur leur bétail des herbes de la Saint
Jean, bouillies dans de l’urine pour le préserver des mauvais sorts.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” Réclus, p. 98.)</p>

<p>We should not forget that from the earliest recorded times the
cedar and juniper have been devoted to sacred offices. “The god of
the cedar, to which tree was ascribed a peculiar power to avert fatal
influences and sorcery.” (This, among the Accadians, the earliest known
inhabitants of Mesopotamia.)—(See “Chaldean Magic,” Lenormant, p.
178.)</p>

<p>From a very early date, urine seems to have been symbolized or
superseded by holy water, salt and water, “celestial water,” “fore-spoken
water,” juniper water, or wine or water, according to circumstances.
“For lung disorders in cattle ... take fennel and hassock,
etc.... make five crosses of hassuck-grass, set them on four sides of
the cattle, and one in the middle; sing about the cattle Benedicam,
etc.... Sprinkle holy water upon them, burn about them incense.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. iii. p. 57; the same remedy for diseased
sheep, idem, p. 57.)</p>

<p>“If a horse or other beast be shot (elf-shot) take seed of dock and
Scotch wax, let a mass priest sing twelve masses over them, and put
holy water on the horse.”—(Idem, vol. iii. p. 47; again, vol. iii. p.
157.)</p>

<p>“When a contagious disease enters among cattle, the fire is extinguished
in some villages round; then they force fire with a wheel, or
by rubbing a piece of dry wood upon another, and therewith burn
juniper in the stalls of the cattle that the smoke may purify the air
about them; they likewise boil juniper in water which they sprinkle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
upon the cattle.”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 286, art. “Physical
Charms,” quoting Shaw’s “History of the Province of Moray in
Scotland.” Brand thinks that “this is, no doubt, a Druid custom.”)</p>

<p>Scot, in his “Discoverie” (p. 157), says: “Men are preserved from
witchcraft by sprinkling of holy water,” etc. (Idem, vol. i. p. 19, art.
“Sorcery.”) “For the devils are observed to have delicate nostrils,
abominating and flying some kind of stinks; witness the flight of the
evil spirit into the remote parts of Egypt, driven by the smell of the
fish’s liver, burnt by Tobit.” Conjurors are reported as always careful
to “first exorcise the wine and water which they sprinkle on their
circle.”—(Idem, vol. iii. pp. 55, 57, art. “Sorcery.”)</p>

<p>The foul condition of the atmosphere of sleeping-apartments was
supposed to be rectified by the burning of juniper, sometimes of rosemary.
“He doth sacrifice two pence in juniper to her every morning.”
(“Every Man out of his Humor,” Ben Jonson) “Then put fresh water
into both the bough-pots, and burn a little juniper in the hall chimney.
Like a beast, as I was, I pissed out the fire last night.” (“Mayor
of Tumborough,” Beaumont and Fletcher.) “Burn a little juniper in
my murrin; the maid made it in her chamber-pot.”—(“Cupid’s Rev.”
Beaumont and Fletcher, iv. 3; contributed by Dr. Fletcher.)</p>

<p>The diuretic effects of juniper berries are well known; we may conjecture
that the “water of juniper” superseded another fluid induced
by the use of the berries.</p>

<p>The “fore-spoken water” with which sick cattle are sprinkled in the
Orkneys, is still to be noted in places in the Highlands.—(See Brand,
“Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 274, art. “Physical Charms.”)</p>

<p>The following spell is from Herrick’s “Hesperides,” p. 304:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Holy water come and bring;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Idem, vol. iii. p. 58, art. “Sorcerer.”)</p>

<p>“The charmer muttered some words over water, in imitation of
Catholic priests consecrating holy water.”—(“Phil. of Magic,” Salverte,
p. 52. Shetland Islands.)</p>

<p>According to Dalyell, this “fore-spoken water” was made of water,
salt, and the saliva of the conjurer.—(See “Superstitions of Scotland,”
p. 98.)</p>

<p>“For information of a cherished relative and his fate, in the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
world, they apply to the fetich-priest, who takes a little child and
bathes his face with lustral-water.”—(“Fetichism,” Baudin, p. 65.)</p>

<p>The “lustral water” of the foregoing paragraph, is made of “snails
and vegetable butter.”—(Idem, p. 88.)</p>

<p>Reginald Scot gives a “cure” for one “possessed,” one point of
which is that the victim “must mingle holy water with his meate and
his drink, and holy salt also must be a portion of the mixture.”
(“Discoverie,” p. 178.) Witches were required to drink holy water at
their trials.—(Idem, p. 21.)</p>

<p>Salt was called “divine” by the ancients.—(See “Morals,” Plutarch,
Goodwin’s English edit., Boston, 1870, vol. iii. p. 338.)</p>

<p>“Both Greeks and Romans mixed salt with their sacrificial cakes;
in their lustrations, also, they made use of salt and water, which gave
rise, in after times, to the superstition of holy water.”—(Brand,
“Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 161, art. “Salt Falling.”)</p>

<p>The Scottish use of salt and water, as already noted, is described by
Black (“Folk Medicine,” p. 23); and by Napier (“Folk-Lore,” pp.
36, 37.)</p>

<p>Salt is put in the cradle of a new-born babe in Holland.—(“Times,”
New York, Nov. 10, 1889.) “No one will go out on any material
affairs without putting some salt in their pockets; much less remove
from one house to another, marry, put out a child, or take one to
nurse, without salt being interchanged.” (Dalyell, “Superst. of
Scotland,” p. 96.) Salt is not used by the Eastern Inuit: “Le sel
leur répugne, peut-être parceque l’atmosphère et les poissons crus en
sont déjà saturés.”—(“Les Primitifs,” Réclus, p. 33.)</p>

<p>Having shown that witches were exorcised in France, England, Scotland,
etc., by sprinkling with urine, we have reason to claim the following
treatment to be at least cousin-german to our subject. In the
west of Scotland, a peasant suffering from a mysterious and obstinate
disease, was reputed to be under the influence of the “evil eye.”
The following remedy was then resorted to: “An old sixpence is borrowed
from some neighbor, without telling the object to which it is to
be applied; as much salt as can be lifted upon the sixpence is put into
a tablespoonful of water and melted; the sixpence is then put into the
solution, and the soles of the feet and palms of the hands of the patient
are moistened three times with the salt water; it is then tasted three
times, and the patient ‘scored aboun the breath,’ that is, by the
operator dipping the fore finger into the salt water and drawing it
along the brow. When this is done, the contents of the spoon are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
thrown behind and right over the fire, the throwers at the same time
saying: ‘Lord preserve us from all scathe.’”—(Brand, “Pop. Ant.”
vol. iii. p. 47, art. “Fascination of Witches.”)</p>

<p>Wright calls attention to the fact that at the meetings of witches,
“at times, every article of luxury was placed before them, and they
feasted in the most sumptuous manner. Often, however, the meats
served on the table were nothing but toads and rats, and other articles
of a revolting nature. In general they had no salt, and but seldom
bread.” After these feasts came “wild and uproarious dancing and
revelry.... Their backs, instead of their faces, were turned inwards....
It may be observed, as a curious circumstance, that the modern
waltz is first traced among the meetings of the witches and their imps....
The songs were generally obscene or vulgar, or ridiculous.”—(“Sorcery
and Magic,” Thomas Wright, London, 1851, pp. 310, 311,
328, 329.)</p>

<p>Reginald Scot also states that the waltz was derived from the dance
of the witches.—(See “Discoverie,” p. 36.)</p>

<p>The presents which the devil gave to witches all turned into filth
the next morning.—(See Grimm, “Teut. Mythol.,” vol. iii. p. 1070.)</p>

<p>For a specimen of the filthy in literature, read the dream of Zador
of Vera Cruz, who wished to sell his soul to the devil, in “El Bachiller
de Salamanca,” Le Sage, Paris, 1847, part iv. cap. 2, p. 129.</p>

<p>The best explanation of the above story—which represents Zador as
making a compact with his satanic majesty whereby in exchange for
Zador’s soul the devil discloses a gold mine in a graveyard, from which
the poor dupe extracts enough for his present needs, and then marks
the locality by an ingenious method, only to be awakened by his angry
wife to the mortifying consciousness that he has defiled his own bed—is
that it reflects the current opinion of the Spaniards of Le Sage’s
era in regard to the transmutability of the gifts received from the evil
one. See the story of the god “Kutka.”</p>

<p>“Popular tales, which most frequently arise from traditions ...
are remnants of olden times, and illustrate them.... When a vicious
or evil spirit is mentioned in any tale or popular tradition, I consider
it always implies a reminiscence of some being who formerly, during
the supremacy of a religion now rejected, was worshipped as a god.
He is considered to benefit his worshippers, but to molest those who
hold another belief. Mankind, when in a rude state, often attribute
their own intolerance to their gods. Thus mankind creates his own
god after his own image.”—(Sven Nilson, “The Primitive Inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
of Scandinavia,” edited by Sir John Lubbock, London, 1868,
Preface, liii.)</p>

<p>Speculation would lead to no profitable result were we to endeavor
by its aid—the only means now left us—to fathom the obscurity
surrounding the rites and dances, and especially the foods of those
witches’ gatherings.</p>

<p>Doctor Dupouy, in “Le Moyen Age Médical,” to which special attention
is due, advances an opinion which seems to cover much of the
ground in a logical manner. This in one word, amounts to the belief
that the witches’ gatherings of Europe were not figments of the imagination,
but really existed, and were the conventions of votaries of the
cults stamped out of existence, and only traceable in the distorted and
outlandish features which would most naturally commend themselves
to an ignorant peasantry. “Among these sorcerers there were old panderers,
who knew from personal experience all practices of debauchery,
and who gave the name of ‘vigils’ to the saturnalia indulged in among
villagers on certain nights,—gatherings composed of bawds and pimps,
to which were invited numerous novices in libidinousness. These sorcerers
and witches also knew the remedies that young girls must take
when they wish to destroy the physiological results of their own imprudence,
and what old men needed to restore their virility. They
knew the medicinal qualities of plants, especially those that stupefied.”—(Translated
by T. C. Minor, M.D., under title of “Medicine in the
Middle Ages,” p. 40.)</p>

<p>The initiates in witchcraft may have been compelled to adopt loathsome
foods as a test of the sincerity of their purposes, or they may
have taken them to induce an intoxication such as that of the Zuñis of
New Mexico and the wild tribes of Siberia. There is still another
hypothesis to be considered before relinquishing this topic. The best
food, we know, was always offered to the deities of the ruling sect, and the
use of any of the appurtenants of the rites of the ruling religion in the
ceremonial of a superseded cult was looked upon as the veriest sacrilege
and blasphemy. For example, the use of holy water at the witches’
sabbath was considered a worse crime than that of being a witch.
Therefore we may conclude that, as the votaries of the superseded
religion did not dare to employ the best, they necessarily had to fall back
upon inferior material out of which to construct their oblations; and
as they assembled generally in mountain recesses, in caves, etc., where
nothing better could be had, they offered themselves in sacrifice,—that
is, they recurred to the old practices of human sacrifice, if indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
they had ever abandoned them, and gave the pledges of their own
hair, saliva, urine, and egestæ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The devil had reproached him for saying his prayers at such a moment.—(Harington,
“Ajax,” pp. 33, 34.)</p>

<p>Mooney relates an instance of the abduction of an Irishwoman by
fairies. She managed to impart to her husband the knowledge of the
means by which her rescue could be accomplished: “He must be ready
with some urine and some chicken-dung, which he must throw upon
her, and then seize her.... Soon he heard the fairies approaching,
and when the noise came in front of him he threw the dung and urine
in the direction of the sound, and saw his wife fall from her horse.”
(“The Medical Mythology of Ireland,” James Mooney, Amer. Phil. Society,
1887.) The Irish peasantry firmly believe in the power of the
fairies to carry off their children; to effect a restoration, “a wise
woman” is summoned, whose method is to “heat the shovel in the
fireplace, place the changeling upon it, and put it out upon the dung-hill.”
(Idem.) “Fire, iron, and dung, the three great safeguards
against the influence of fairies and the infernal spirits.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>The peasantry of Ireland carry about the person “medicine bags”
very much like those in use among the North American Indians.
Among the contents of these bags “are usually found tobacco, garlic,
salt, chicken-dung, lus-crea, and some dust from the roadside.” (Idem.)
This is “carried as a protection against the fairies; ... also as a
protection against the evil eye; and something of the same nature is
sewed into the clothing of the bride when her friends are preparing
her for the marriage ceremony.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“A charm to be said each morning by a witch fasting, or at least
before she goes abroad: ‘The fire bite, the fire bite; hog’s turd over
it, hog’s turd over it, hog’s turd over it! The Father with thee; the
Son with thee; the Holy Ghost between us both to be!’ This last
refrain three times; then spit over one shoulder, and then over the
other, and then three times right forward.”—(Scot, “Discoverie,”
p. 177.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></p>

<p>“Item. They hang ... garlicke in the roof of the house for to
keep away witches and spirits, ... and so they do alicium likewise.”—(Idem,
p. 192.)</p>

<p>Garlic was put in the cradle of a new-born babe in Holland.—(“Times,”
New York, Nov. 10, 1889.)</p>

<p>Garlic could not be eaten by the monks or nuns of Thibet (Bhikshuni);
to eat it was considered a sin. “140. Si une Bhikshuni mange
de l’ail,” etc. But in a footnote it is stated that it might be eaten
when it was the only remedy for some disease or infirmity; but even
then the patient should not enter a dormitory, a latrine, could not expound
the law, mingle with brahmins, enter a park, a market, or a
temple until he had undergone a three days’ purification, been bathed
and fumigated.—(See “Pratimoksha Sutra,” translated by W. W.
Rockhill, Paris, 1885, Société Asiatique.)</p>

<span class="smaller">A FEW REMARKS UPON TEMPLE OR SACRED PROSTITUTION, AND UPON THE HORNS OF CUCKOLDS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“The bawds of Amsterdam believed (in 1637) that horse’s dung
dropped before the house and put fresh behind the door ...
would bring good luck to their houses.”—(“Le Putanisme d’Amsterdam,”
p. 56, quoted in Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 18,
article “Sorcery.”)</p>

<p>While a sacred origin cannot be claimed for prostitution in general,
all, or nearly all, temples must in the early ages of mankind have been
provided with prostitutes. The necessity for such a provision is obvious.
Man’s superstition and ignorance invested certain localities, or
the guardian spirits of those localities, with the power to work him
weal or woe, unless kept in good humor by oblations and sacrifices.
Temples were erected on such foundations, tended by priests, who
waxed fat and enriched themselves, because the right of asylum attached
to their position, although such a right did not absolutely attach
to the little communities which insensibly grew up around these
temples. The necessities of national administration and of international
or inter-tribal arbitration, would naturally attract periodically to
those temples the law-makers, the great chiefs and their followers, perhaps
to settle their disputes or arrange their treaties by personal discussion,
perhaps by the decision of the arch-priest.</p>

<p>At such gatherings, no inconsiderable amount of barter and traffic
would spring up, and many, of a mercantile turn of mind, would realize
the advantages of a permanent residence. The sailors and merchants
from foreign parts could not always be expected to behave with propriety;
they might, at times, be as anxious to “paint the town red”
as the western cowboy is whenever he is paid off. The women of the
city would be in constant danger of insult; hence, as a wise precaution,
a certain class of young and attractive females were reserved
for the service of the temples,—that is, for the gratification of the
sexual passions of strangers and the enrichment of the priests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, until some such mode of detail had been devised and carried
into effect, and perhaps long after that, it seems to have been the
custom for all the women of the city to share in this duty; we read
that, at the temple of Mylitta, it was incumbent upon each woman to
prostitute herself with a stranger at least once in her life, at the temple
of that goddess.</p>

<p>The priests would impart to the prostitutes a knowledge of charms
intended to secure good fortune; these charms would, in course of
time, be adopted by prostitutes in general, who had no connection
with the temple at all. Similar survivals can be traced among gamblers.
Gambling was at one time a sacred method of divination.
Those who cast omens were always on the lookout for good signs and
bad. One of the best signs was to meet a man with a hump-back.
Gamblers to-day consider themselves fortunate when they can rub the
hump of a cripple.</p>

<p>This sacred prostitution was by no means confined to the Babylonians.
The Hebrews had, attached to their temples, a class of persons
of both sexes termed “Kadeshim,” to whom the opprobrious office of
public prostitution has been attributed; and in numerous other parts
of the world the same sort of personal degradation has been reported.
The women devoted to this service wore a certain uniform. (See Dulaure,
“Des Différents Cultes,” vol. ii. p. 75, speaking of the “Kadeshoth.”
See also Smith’s “Dictionary of the Bible,” New York, 1871,
articles, “Harlot” and “Sodomite.”)</p>

<p>“The sons of Eli lay with the women that assembled at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.”—(1 Samuel ii. 22.)</p>

<p>“Throughout India, and also through the densely inhabited parts
of Asia and modern Turkey, there is a class of females who dedicate
themselves to the service of the Deity whom they adore, and the
rewards accruing from their prostitution are devoted to the service of
the temple and the priests officiating therein. The temples of the
Hindus in the Dekkan possessed these establishments. They had
bands of consecrated dancing-girls, called “women of the idol,” selected
in their infancy by the priests for the beauty of their persons, and
trained up with every elegant accomplishment that could render them
attractive.”—(“The Masculine Cross,” privately printed, 1886, p. 31.)</p>

<p>Réclus has a dissertation upon this subject, which concludes in these
words: “Aussi Juvénal se permettait de demander, ... Quel est le
temple où les femmes ne se prostituent pas?”—(“Les Primitifs,”
p. 79.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p>Lenormant speaks of “the sacred prostitution, which was imposed
once, at least, in a lifetime, upon all women, even those who were
free.”—(“Chaldean Magic,” François Lenormant, p. 386.)</p>

<p>“Caindu is an heathenish nation, where, in honor of their idols,
they prostitute their wives, sisters, and daughters to the lust of travellers.”—(Purchas,
vol. v. p. 430. Caindu seems to have been a
territory adjacent to Thibet.)</p>

<p>“Sometimes, at the command of a wizard, a man orders his wife to
go to an appointed place, usually a wood, and abandon herself to the
first person she meets. Yet there are women who refuse to comply
with such orders.”—(Patagonia, “Voyage of Adventure and Beagle,”
vol. ii. p. 154.)</p>

<p>“The people of Khasrowan, a Christian province in the Libanus,
inhabited by a peculiarly prurient race, also hold high festival under
the far-famed cedars, and their women sacrifice to Venus, like the
‘Kadeshah’ of the Phœnicians. This survival of old superstition is
unknown to missionary ‘hand-books,’ but amply deserves the study
of the anthropologist.”—(Burton, “Arabian Nights,” terminal essay,
vol. x. 230.)</p>

<p>The religious prostitution of the ancient Babylonians seems also to
survive, in a small degree, in the petty hamlets of Kesfin and Martaouan,
near Aleppo, in Syria. “The women carry their hospitality
as far as those of Babylon of old. This authorized prostitution
seems to be a remnant of the old Asiatic superstitions.”—(Maltebrun,
“Universal Geography,” vol. i. p. 353, lib. 28.) Dulaure cites the
case of Martaouan, and also quotes Marco Polo in evidence of the existence
of the same practices in Kamul, near Tanguth.—(“Des Dif.
Cultes,” vol. ii. pp. 598, 599.)</p>

<p>“Most eastern temples, and especially those connected with the
solar cult, had, and for the most part still have, ‘Deva-Dasis’ temple,
or ‘God’s women,’ the followers of Mylitta, though generally not
seated so confessedly nor so prominently as those whom Herodotus
describes. They were doubtless the women with mirrors (Ezek.
viii. 14) who wept for Tamuz, the sun-god.” (“Rivers of Life,”
Forlong, vol. i. p. 329.) The African goddess Odudua promised protection
“to all those who would establish themselves in this place, and
erect to her a temple in place of the cabin. Many persons came and
established themselves here, and thus was founded Ado, which means
prostitution in memory of the goddess.”—(“Fetichism,” Baudin, p. 17.)
“The temple erected in this city is celebrated among the blacks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
The neighboring kings offer an ox to the goddess on her feast-day,
and, in accordance with the legend, impure games are celebrated
in her honor.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“In the Babylonian worship of the goddess Mylitta, the women
who offered themselves for a price to the stranger at the door of the
temple were distinguished by a peculiar apparel, according to Baruch.... The
women sit in the ways, girded with cordes of rushes and
burnt straw,” and “their resting-places distinguished with cords.”—(Purchas’s
“Pilgrims,” vol. v. p. 56, art. “Hondius’ Babylonia.”)</p>

<p>In Ireland, at the present day, the peasantry make use, in divination
and witchcraft, of “Saint Bridget’s cord,” made of rushes, and
corresponding closely to the cord of the goddess Mylitta.</p>

<p>We are not informed that horns were assumed as a distinctive feature
of such uniform, but we are constantly kept in mind of the fact
that many, if not all, of the deities of the countries adjacent to the
Mediterranean were at one time or another represented with horns as
symbols of power. What, therefore, is more reasonable than to suppose
that the woman thus employed was decked with a head-dress of
horns? Or that her husband, without whose permission such prostitution
would have been impossible, and for whom it must have been
an act of equal religious importance, was similarly decorated?</p>

<p>When new religions had succeeded in trampling into the dust the
sacred usages of the past, the fierce intolerance of the fanatic would
have had no greater delight than in ridiculing that which had been
the distinctive feature, perhaps, of the cult so recently overthrown.
Therefore the association of horns, formerly the typical attribute of
the heathen gods, would be transferred to the betrayed husband, and
what had been the outward sign of the most devout self-negation
would be turned into ridicule and opprobrium.</p>

<p>Brand, “Pop. Ant.,” vol. ii. pp. 181 <i>et seq.</i> gives a perfect flood of
information on this subject, but nothing very satisfactory or definite,—art.
“Cornutes.”</p>

<p>“Actæon, a cuckold; from the horns placed on the head of Actæon
by Diana.” (Grose, “Dict. of Buckish Slang,” London, 1811.) This
myth may conceal the story of the intrusion of Actæon upon sacred
ceremonies of prostitution or his personal association therewith.</p>

<p>“Highgate; sworn at Highgate. A ridiculous custom formerly prevailed
at the public houses in Highgate, to administer a ludicrous
oath to all travellers of the middling class who stopped there. The
party was sworn on a pair of horns, fastened on a stick; the substance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
of the oath was never to kiss the maid when he could kiss the mistress;
never to drink small beer when he could get strong; with many
other injunctions of the same kind, to all of which was added the
saving clause,—‘unless you like it best.’ The person administering
the oath was always to be called father by the juror, and he, in return,
was to style him son, under penalty of a bottle.”—(Grose, “Dictionary
of Buckish Slang.”)</p>

<p>“Horn Fair; an annual fair, held at Carlton, in Kent, on Saint Luke’s
day, the 18th of October. It consists of a riotous mob, who, after a
printed summons, dispersed through the adjacent towns, meet at Cuckold’s
Point, near Deptford, and march from thence in procession through
that town and Greenwich to Charlton, with horns of different kinds
upon their heads; and at the fair there are sold rams’ horns and every
sort of toy made of horn; even the gingerbread figures have horns.
The vulgar tradition gives the following history of the origin of this
fair. King John, or some other of our ancient kings, being at the
palace of Eltham in this neighborhood, and having been out hunting
one day, rambled from his company to this place, then a mean hamlet,
when, entering a cottage to inquire his way, he was struck with the
beauty of the mistress, whom he found alone; and having prevailed
over her modesty, the husband, returning suddenly, surprised them
together, and threatening to kill them both, the king was obliged to
discover himself, and to compound for his safety with a purse of gold,
and a grant of the land from this place to Cuckold’s Point, besides
making the husband master of the hamlet. It is added that, in
memory of this, the fair was established for the sale of horns, and
all sorts of goods made of that material.”—(Grose, idem.)</p>

<p>“In Minorca, the inhabitants have as much hatred of the word
‘cuerno’ as they have of ‘diablo.’” (See Brand, “Pop. Ant.,”
vol. ii. p. 186, art. “Cornutes.”) Possibly we have here an example
of the influence of the early Christian church exerted to make detestable
everything connected with the deposed religion of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The horn still figures among the African tribes. Whenever one of
the petty kings at the head of the Nile “wishes to communicate with
another, he sends on the messenger’s neck a horn, ... which serves
both for credentials and security.... No one dare touch a Mbakka
with one of these horns upon his neck.”—(Speke, “Nile,” London,
1863, vol. ii. pp. 509, 521.)</p>

<p>Bruce says that, after a victory, the Abyssinian commanders wear a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
head-dress, surmounted by a horn,—a conical piece of silver,—gilt,
about four inches long, much in the shape of our common candle-extinguishers.
This is called kern, or horn, and is only worn in parades
or reviews after victory. This, I apprehend, like all other of
their usages, is taken from the Hebrews, and the several allusions
made in Scripture to arise from this practice. “I said unto fools,
Deal not foolishly, and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn.” And
so in many other places throughout the Psalms.—(Bruce, “Nile,”
Dublin, 1791, vol. iii. p. 551. See also “Encyclopædia of Geography,”
Philadelphia, 1845, vol. ii. p. 588, art. “Abyssinia.” See also under
“Mistletoe;” “Milk,” and “Semen,” under “Pharmacy;” extract from
Pliny; extract from Lentilius; extract from Etmuller; “Perspiration,”
under “Pharmacy,” and others.)</p>

<p>A “black letter” copy of “Malleus Maleficarum,” one of the
“incunabula” from the press of Peter Schœffer, Mayence, 1487, was
carefully examined; but besides being very dim and extremely hard to
decipher, it contained nothing not already given from other authorities.</p>

<span class="smaller">CURES BY TRANSPLANTATION.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The most curious method of alleviating physical and mental disorders
was that termed by various writers: “Cures by Transplantation,”
by “Translation,” by “Sympathy,” and by “Magnetic
Transference.”</p>

<p>There is a perfect embarrassment of riches on this division of our
subject, and the difficulty has been not to select, but to know what to
reject.</p>

<p>Etmuller enumerates five different kinds of cures by transplantation:
1. Insemenation, wherein “magnes mumia” (the spirit distilled
from mummy flesh) was used to water the rich earth in which
certain seed had been planted; but care must be taken in the selection
of the plant, some being beneficial, others noxious; 2. Implantatio,
where a plant, already growing, or the root only of such a plant is
selected, and watered as above described; 3. Impositio, where some
of the skin of the diseased member, or some of the patient’s excrement,
or anything else intimately connected with him, “aut ejus excrementum
aut utrumque,” is inserted between the bark and body of a tree,
and the opening then tamped with mud. But in every case bear in
mind that if a slow, gradual cure is to be brought about, a slow-growing
tree must be selected; but for a speedy recovery, a quick-growing
tree; 4. Inoratio, in which daily certain trees or plants, until cure
results, are to be watered with the “urina, sudore, fecibus alvi vel
lotura membri aut totius corporis;” but it is recommended that each
irrigation be covered up with earth, to keep out the air; 5. Inescatio,
where “mummy” is given to an animal to eat; the animal will die,
the patient recover.</p>

<p>Human ordure was a frequent addition to the “spiritus mumiæ.”</p>

<p>Frommann opens the way to a clearer understanding of the principles
upon which these cures depended. He states that not all diseases were
thus curable; only those which in themselves were “movable.” Poison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
could not be so cured, because its lethal action was effected too
quickly for the slow-moving remedial agency of transplantation. Injuries
to the “vital faculties,” such as “aneurisms of the aorta,” etc.,
were not transplantable. Worms ditto, although they were able to
move of their own will. “Lipothymia” or syncope, was not transferable.
All “transplantable” diseases were called “saline” diseases, because,
according to the medical theories prevailing in those days, they
originated in some defect of the “salts” of the body.—(See Frommann,
“Tract. de Fascinatione,” pp. 1017, 1018.)</p>

<p>Among the strongest “magnetic” medicines, according to Paracelsus,
was the one “ex stercore humano.”—(See Etmuller, vol. i. p. 69.)</p>

<p>There was another: “Take a sufficient quantity of the ordure of a
healthy man, and make it into a poultice with human urine, to which
add sweat gathered from the body with a sponge; place this in a clean
place in the shade until it dries, and when needed for use, moisten with
human blood.” “Recipe copiosum stercus hominis sani, et hoc cum
urina ejusdem misce, redige in consistentiam pultis, adde quantum
habere potes sudoris ex hominibus sanis a linteo aut spongia collecti,
ponantur simul in loco mundo in umbra donec siccentur, hinc adde sanguinem
recentem, misce, sicca, et ad usum reserva.”</p>

<p>Etmuller also mentions a “sympathetic” cure for quartan ague, in
which the hair of the patient was to be mixed with food and thrown to
birds, which, swallowing the food, took away the fever.</p>

<p>Another method was to take the clippings of the toe and finger
nails of the sick person, place them in an egg and throw them to the
birds; others again wrap them up in wax and early in the morning,
before the rising of the sun, affix the parcel to the door of a neighbor’s
house, or else tie it to the back of a living crab, and throw the crab
back into the stream: “Sunt cui ad curandam febrem segmenta e
manibus et pedibus ovo includunt, avibusque devoranda objiciunt; alii
eadem ceræ involvunt, matutinoque tempore ante solis ortum januæ
affigunt, aliii dorso cancri vivi alligant, cancrumque fluenti committunt.”—(Idem,
vol. ii. p. 265.)</p>

<p>The first excrement of a man sick with dysentery was mixed with
salt as a “magnetic” cure; to this, some people added the powder of
eel-skins (Frommann, “Tractatus,” p. 1012, <i>et seq.</i>). Yellow jaundice
patients urinated upon clean linen sheets; if they succeeded in dyeing
them yellow they would recover soon; if not, not (p. 1012); roots wet
with the patient’s urine were burned as a cure for the yellow jaundice (p.
1013); all the clothing of an epileptic patient was burned, and the ashes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
thrown in a stream, down-stream (p. 1013); especially was this the
case if any of it had been defiled by alvine dejections voided in one of
the paroxysms; and the same care was taken to burn this excrement
(p. 1013). (Note that epilepsy was always regarded as the sacred
disease; here we have a suggestion of human sacrifice.)</p>

<p>The method of curing by digging up the ground, depositing some
plant and enriching the surrounding soil with the patient’s egestæ is
given by Frommann (p. 1016); but the trees or plants to be selected
for this purpose were to be those of forests or those which bore edible
fruits, “ut fraxinus, quercus, betula, tilia, fagus, alnus,” etc. (Ash, oak,
birch, linden, beech, alder, etc.) The animals had to be such as did
not eat human flesh, as “canes, feles, equi, lupi, vulpes;” others could
be used on occasion, but the results were not so sure (idem, p. 1017).
There were two general methods: one, in which the “sanguis, pili,
excrementa” of the patient himself were offered; the other, in which
crabs, meat, eggs, lard, apples, and other things, were rubbed to the
affected parts and then offered (idem.)</p>

<p>Beckherius gives the recipe for effecting a “sympathetic cure” of
fever by clipping the finger and toe-nails of the patient and tying these
clippings in a rag to the door of a neighbor’s house. “Si resegmine
unguium e manibus et pedibus deprompta, cera involvantur, matutininoque
tempore ante solis exortum alienæ januæ affiguntur.” And
wicked people were in the habit of preparing a draught composed of
equal parts of their dirty finger-nails and cantharides, and whoever
drank that in his liquor fell into a condition of atrophy (Med. mic.
pp. 15, 16). When the patient’s own hair was used in these cures, it
was placed in an egg and thrown to chickens.—(Idem, p. 8.)</p>

<p>Frommann speaks of enclosing fragments of the patient’s nails and
clippings of his hair in knots and throwing these in the road to be untied
by some curious person who would catch the disease.—(“Tract.
de Fascinatione,” p. 1003.)</p>

<p>The blood, urine, or excrement of the patient was to be placed in an
egg-shell and fed to barn-yard fowl.—(Idem.)</p>

<p>“Id quod alio modo per urinam ægri quoque fieri valet; qua ratione
cum sanguine, urina, excrementis, ægrotantis multæ sympatheticæ
curæ fieri possunt;” and to this class belong such remedies as cutting
an apple or a piece of bacon in half, then hanging the piece up in the
chimney to melt or rot; as fast as this was effected, the disease disappeared.
Speaking of transplantation, he says: “Prioris exemplum
est dum applicato stercore humano ad certam aliquam partem transplantatur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
eo ipso morbo in plantam cujus semen in terram hoc stercore
mistam inferitur.” The first example is where the ordure of the
patient is applied to a certain plant, and thus transfers the disease
from the patient to the plant.—(Etmuller, “Opera Omnia,” vol. i.
p. 69, Lyons, 1696.)</p>

<p>Etmuller teaches that clippings of the toe and finger nails tied to
the back of a living crab, which was then to be thrown into a stream
by a man who would perform the duty and return home without speaking
would effect cures; similarly, for the alleviation of gout, he recommends
that these clippings be buried in a hole made in the bark of an
oak which should then be closed with a wedge: “Abscinduntur ungues
manuum et pedum, alligantur dorso cancri viventis, et cancer istis
unguibus oneratus, immittitur in flumen retrofaciem redeundo sine
loquela, donec in domum facta fuerit reversio. Instituuntur qq. transplantationes
pro viribus recuperandis per ungues. Sic in podagræ....
R.; Ungues pedis, atque immittuntur in foramen excavatum in
quercum et super foramen ponunt cuneum ex quo subito fit, ut remittat
dolor ac desinat Podagra” (vol. ii. p. 270.)</p>

<p>Etmuller mentions the cure by tying the fragments of finger and
toe nails to a crab, in another place in his works. For the recovery of
impaired strength, these clippings should be buried in the bark of a
cherry-tree, which should then be closed with ordure: “Ad recuperandos
vires abscissos ungues et capillos cerasi radici incisæ imponunt,
vulnusque fimo co-operiunt.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 265.)</p>

<p>“Denique si quid aliud singulare est si quis accipiat ovum recens,
hoc coquat cum urina propria ad assumptionem medietatis, quo facto
urina superstes projiciatur in flumen secundum ejusdem cursum, ovum
vel ita coctum leviter apertur immittatur in acervum formicarum.
Unde quando formicæ assumpserunt ovum solutem erit fascinum”
(idem, vol. i. p. 462). “Finally, there is this singular method of
taking a fresh egg and putting it in some of the patient’s own urine,
which is boiled down one half; the supernatant urine is then to be
thrown into a stream (down current) and the egg itself buried in an
ant-heap; as fast as the ants consume the egg, the effects of the witchcraft
vanish.”</p>

<p>Again, for the cure of gout, toe and finger nails were to be cut and
placed in an aperture in the bark of an oak-tree: “Vel dum ungues
pedum abscissi et in quercum terebratam inclusi, hominem liberum
reddunt a podagra.”—(Idem, p. 69, vol. i.)</p>

<p>Urine was of great use in curing people bitten by serpents. “Per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
urinam solent fieri curationes magico-magneticæ morborum, si scillicet
lardum vel potius caro porcina coquatur ter in urina ægri et caro ista
incoctionis urinæ postmodum propinetur cani vel porco devoranda, sic
enim sit, ut quam plurimi morbi curentur per transplantationem in
animalia quæ devorant carnem et urinam.”—(Etmuller, p. 271.)</p>

<p>Hog-lard or a lardy hog-skin, rubbed on warts and then suspended
in the chimney or buried in horse-dung, caused the warts to disappear
as fast as it decayed. “Suspendatur in camino furni, vel in fimo
equino sepeliatur.... Sicut exsiccatur in fumo, vel putrescit in fimo
lardum ita exsiccetur et putrescat verruca.” (Idem.) Half a dozen
methods of employing hog-dung are given.</p>

<p>Frommann quotes Ratray as saying from his own observation that
there was a “sympathy” between the patient’s urine when enclosed in
a glass vial and the condition of the patient himself,—a sort of “barometrical”
sympathy, as we would term it. At an earlier period of
culture the urine would have been placed in the horn of a goat, or in
the bladder of a hog.</p>

<p>The methods of effecting these cures by placing the patient’s urine
in an ants’ nest, in any manner, are all given by Johannes Christianus
Frommann (“Tract. de Fascinat.,” pp. 1004 <i>et seq.</i>); also the method
by boiling an egg in the urine and placing the egg in the nest of ants
(p. 1005); also the method of making bread with the patient’s urine,
and giving the bread to a dog to eat (p. 1005). In Italy there was a
variant of this custom, consisting in giving bread made with the urine
of a male patient to a male dog, and that made with the urine of a sick
woman to a bitch (idem). Yellow jaundice was cured by boiling a
piece of meat in the patient’s urine and giving said meat to a dog
(idem); for the cure of rupture the patient should soak some barley
in his urine, and then bury the barley in the bark of a tree (p. 1007).
Another mode of cure by transplantation was for the patient to urinate
in a vial of glass, stop it up with a linen rag or a paper wad, and bury
it in the earth (p. 1010). For the cure of yellow jaundice, the patient
dug a hole in the ground and urinated therein before sunrise (pp. 1010,
1011); for the cure of dysentery the patient deposited his excrement
on a piece of ash and left it in a hole (p. 1011); fever patients threw
their excrement in a stream (idem). Other modes were to make a mixture
of the urine of the sick man, mixed with ashes, let the mass dry
in the sun, and then put it by the embers of the kitchen fire to bake
(p. 1012); the ordure of a man sick from “incantation” was applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
to the place of the spell, and then hung up (enclosed in a hog’s bladder)
for three days in the smoke of the chimney (idem).</p>

<p>In his long and most interesting chapter upon the cure of diseases by
the use of human ordure, “magically or sympathetically,” Schurig relates
many quaint and curious methods of employment of the alvine
dejections of those supposed to be almost <i>in articulo mortis</i>. For example,
the ordure of the patient was taken, placed in the hollow of a
dead man’s bone, which was then thrown into boiling water. This
remedy, if we can trust Schurig, seems to have been of the highest
efficacy. Another mode was to mix the ordure with the lees of wine
and the pounce of cherries, and let the mass ferment together; or
the ordure was collected and thrown into running water.—(See
Schurig, “Chylologia,” pp. 783, 784. The whole chapter “De Stercoris
Humani Usu Magico seu Sympathetico,” No. xiii. should be
read.)</p>

<p>Goat-urine was applied to sore eyes; but a more certain cure in grave
cases was additionally effected by hanging some of it in a goat’s horn
for twenty days. “Si cum cornu capræ suspenditur diebus viginti.”—(Sextus
Placitus, “De Med. ex Animal.,” article “De Capro.”)</p>

<p>Beckherius has a “sympathetic” cure for the yellow jaundice.
Make a poultice of horse-dung and the patient’s own urine, and hang
it up in the chimney. “Fimum equinum cum urina ægri sic misce,
ut pultis referat consistentiam, hæc linteolo excipe, et in camino suspende
ut fumo semper sunt exposita.” (“Med. Microcos.,” p. 65.)
Another was to hang the urine of the patient in a bladder in the
chimney; as the urine evaporated the patient was to recover. “Propriam
urinam vesica suilla excerpisse et hanc in fumo exposuisse
seque observasse ad exsiccationem. Urina in vesica ipsum quoque
icteritiam evanuisse.” (Idem, p. 65.) Another cure of yellow jaundice
was a dose, morning and evening, of a mixture of human urine
and horse-radish. (Idem, p. 66.) There was still another “sympathetic”
cure: the patient urinated in a vessel, which was allowed to
evaporate by the fire, and this was continued for nine days.—(Idem,
p. 66.)</p>

<p>For consumption Beckherius gives a “sympathetic” cure (already
noted from other sources) of boiling an egg in the patient’s urine until
it hardens, and then burying it in an ant-hill. (Idem, p. 75.) The
same cure was employed in fevers. (Idem.)</p>

<p>A pinch of salt, the size of a big bean, was wrapped in a linen rag,
and dipped in the urine of the patient for a whole day; then heated in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
the fire until it became reddish in color; some of this was sprinkled on
bread, and the patient rubbed with it morning and evening.—(“Medicus
Microcosmus,” pp. 75, 76.)</p>

<p>A fresh egg was boiled in the sick person’s urine, and then thrown
to the fishes. “Recens ovum in urina ægri quod in piscinam ubi
pisces sunt conjiciatur, et momento febrem cessare dicunt.”—(Idem,
p. 78.)</p>

<p>Still another was to make a cake out of flour moistened with the
urine of the sick; throw this to the fishes. The fishes who ate it
would take the disease, and the patient recover. “Subige farinam
cum urina ægri ad formam placentulæ; coque hæc in forno, instar
panis objice piscibus, ut ab iis devoretur; abit febris, maxime quartana.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>Frommann devotes a long chapter to cures by “transplantation.”
He cites from Pliny the method of curing a bad cough by spitting
into the mouth of a toad (tree-toad; see notes already taken), and
also gives another in which the urine of the patient made into a
dough with flour, was given to a dog or hog.—(“Tract. de Fascinat.”
p. 1002.)</p>

<p>Frommann believed with Von Helmont that there was nothing superstitious
about such cures, because there were no rites and no incantations
used. (Idem, p. 1033.) But later on, he mentions having heard
a woman (who was trying one of these cures by rolling some of her
son’s hair in wax and burying the wax ball in an incision in an apple-tree)
recite certain words, which she declined to repeat for him when
asked; hence he was in some doubt about her particular case (p. 1034).
He quotes the English Count of Digby as stating that he knew of a
nurse who carelessly allowed some of a baby’s excrement to be burned
up in a fire; the result was the child suffered terribly from excoriation
of the fundament (p. 1038). The way in which a cure was effected in
this case was the “sympathetic” one of placing the baby’s excrements
for three days in a basin filled with cold water, and exposing in a cold
place (p. 1039).</p>

<p>Dropsy was cured by hanging the patient’s urine (enclosed in a
pig’s bladder) up in a chimney, and neglecting all other remedies.
“Urinam ejus recentem vesica suilla conclusam in camino suspendi,
curavi.” (Idem, p. 1047.) A young virgin was cured of a tertian
fever by giving to a hen bread made with the urine voided during the
paroxysms. The girl recovered; the hen died. “Virginis cujusdam
febre intermittente tertiana laborantis urinam calidam in paroxysmo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
redditam gallinæ familicæ cum pane mistam exhiberi curavi”
(p. 1047).</p>

<p>See also notes from Samuel Augustus Flemming, under “Perspiration.”</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Lanzoni did not believe that any good results followed
the suspension above the earth, in a sow’s bladder, of human urine in
cases of suppression of urine, as was often to be noticed among Jews
and some of the religious orders. “Urinæ suppressionem minime
referare vesicam suis suspensam, quæ non tetigit terram, quod nonnulli
volunt, observavi in quodam Religioso et Hebræo.”—(“Phemer.
Physic-Medic.,” Leipsig, 1694, vol. i. p. 49.)</p>

<p>Paullini taught that fevers of all kinds could be cured by pouring
the patient’s urine into a fish-pond. “Such of the fish as drink of
that water,” he says, “will receive the fever, which will leave the
sick man.”</p>

<p>For the “sympathetic” cure of epilepsy, all the clothing worn by
the patient during the paroxysm, even his shoes, were to be carefully
burned, and the ashes cast into flowing water. More than this; if,
during the attack, the patient had defecated, the ordure was collected,
and with everything touched by it, burned up with the same care.
“Hominis epilepticum insultum primum patientis sive junior sit, sive
senior indumenta omnia et vestes indusium, calcei, tibialis, et similia
sub dio comburantur, et in cinerem redigantur; cinis vero in aquam
fluvialem secundum flumen projiciatur. Si autem jam ante homo
epilepsia laboravit, ad alvi excrementa in ipso paroxysmo reddita attendatur;
quæ si adest res commaculata cum ipsis excrementis modo
jam dicto comburatur.”—(Schurig, “Chylologia,” p. 1013, quoting
Frommann.)</p>

<p>Schurig gives the recipe of Johannes Philippus ab Hertodt for the
preparation of a “sympathetic” powder, which serves to inform us as
to the incoherent ideas of the practitioners of a couple of centuries
ago. Freely translated, it reads, “Take of a healthy human mummy,
moistened with a little urine; let it be dried in a place exposed to an
east wind, but not to the sun, until it shall be reduced to powder;
this is to be mixed with an equal weight of cream of tartar, and the
‘sympathetic powder of vitriol,’ prepared according to formula, in the
dog-days; or of the salt of Hungarian vitriol, heated to whiteness in
a furnace.” A pinch of this sympathetic powder should be sprinkled
upon the feces of the sick person, or upon a cloth dipped in his urine,
and then preserved in a cool place. Its efficacy was vouched for in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
the highest terms: “Effective curat omnia vulnera, ulcera, febres
petechiales, et urina fabulum, periculosissimas hæmorrhagias puerperarum,
arthriditem quamcunque, podagram et illam vagam dictam,
pulmonis apostemata, hæmorrhoides nimias, narium fluxus immodicos,
capitis dolores, catarrhos, fluxos albos mulierum, menstrua copiosa,
morsus canis rabidi, vel alterium cujuscunque animalis, item
mammas ulceratas.”—(Schurig, pp. 775, 776.)</p>

<p>Schurig adds a number of these cures for dysentery, such as
placing the dejecta in the retort used for the distillation of vitriol,
... sprinkling such dejecta with salt, or with vitriol, or mixing them
with hot ashes and live coals; preferably, the excrement to be thus
employed should be the first ejected having a bloody tinge.</p>

<p>“The various modes of application of these remedies are too long for
insertion here, but are valuable to the student as showing how deep-seated
was the belief in the occult properties of the excreta themselves.”—(“Chylologia,”
pp. 785, 786.)</p>

<p>The following is an old French “sympathetic” recipe for the cure
of all kinds of colic: “Pour la colique ce sera ici la recette d’un vilain
remède, mais pourtant sympathique en ceux qui sont tourmentés de
la colique, car s’ils mettent sous la selle percée bien fermée de la fiente
de vache fraichement recueillie, et qu’ils pissent et déchargent les
excréments de leur ventre dessus, par sympathie sans difficulté ils
auront du soulagement.”—(Lazarus Neyssonier, quoted by Schurig,
“Chylologia,” pp. 784, 785.)</p>

<p>For the “sympathetic” cure of hernia, the root of the herb “wall-wort”
was smeared with the ordure of the patient, and then buried
in the ground. “Radicem Symphti Oleto Proprio delibutam et in
terram defossam.”—(Idem, p. 787.)</p>

<p>To stop hemorrhage “sympathetically,” whether from wounds or
other injuries, some of the flowing blood was taken, and mixed with
the ordure of the patient, and the mixture then exposed in a jar to
the action of the air. “Contra hæmorrhagias, sive in læsonibus et
vulneribus, ut sanguis sistatur, misce sanguinem ex sanguine profluentem
cum proprio stercore et in olla ad desiccandum æri libero
expone.”—(Idem, p. 787.)</p>

<p>A patient suffering from yellow jaundice should urinate upon horse-dung
while warm. This same remedy seems to have been in vogue in
helping women in the expulsion of the placenta. One of the prescriptions
given by Schurig states that the horse-dung must be from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
an animal that was not tired at the time of the evacuation,—“non
defatigati.”—(Idem, p. 812 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>A “sympathetic” cure by the use of the dung of horses seems to
be implied in the case of infants’ small-pox, where we find it suspended
in beer; “pendatur in cerevisiam ... propterea ne fauces affligantur
a variolis quod alias solet esse casus periculosissimus.”—(Etmuller,
vol. ii. p. 264.)</p>

<p>“There is no doubt that the practice was at one time very general,
but it would now be a waste of time to go into particulars respecting
the various compositions of the sympathetical curers; the manner in
which their vitriol was to be prepared by exposure for three hundred
and sixty-five days to the sun, the unguents of human fat and blood,
mummy, moss of dead man’s skull, bull’s blood and fat, and other
disgusting ingredients.”—(“Medical Superstitions,” Pettigrew, Philadelphia,
1844, p. 206.)</p>

<p>For ague, “let the urine of the sick body, made early in the morning,
be softly heated nine daies continually untill all be consumed
into vapour.”—(Reginald Scot, “Discoverie,” p. 196.)</p>

<p>In Great Britain and Ireland, “ague in a boy is cured by a cake
made of barley-meal and his urine, and given to a dog to eat; the
dog, in the case cited, had a shaking fit, and the boy was cured.”
(“Folk-Medicine,” Black, p. 35. In a footnote there is added, “Pettigrew,
‘Superstitions connected with the practice of Medicine and Surgery,’
p. 77.”) Madame de Scudery mentions a similar cure for fever
in a letter of date 20th of October, 1677, to the Comte de Bussy.
Speaking of an abbé of fame, “On dit qu’il ne fait que prendre pour
toutes les fièvres de l’urine des malades dans laquelle il fait durcir un
œuf hors de sa coque, après quoi il le donne à manger à un chien qui
prend en même temps la fièvre du malade qui par ce moien en guérit.
C’est une question de fait que je n’ay pas éprouvée.”—(“Notes and
Queries,” 5th series, vol. viii. p. 126.)</p>

<p>The following are given as cures by “transplantation.” “Seven or
nine—it must be an odd number—cakes, made of the newly emitted
urine of the patient, with the ashes of ash wood, and buried for some
days in a dunghill, will, according to Paracelsus, cure the yellow
jaundice.” In the journal of Dr. Edward Browne, transmitted to his
father, Sir Thomas Browne, we read of “a magical cure for the jaundice:
Burn wood under a laden vessel filled with water; take the ashes
of that wood, and boyle it with the patient’s urine; then lay nine long
heaps of the boyld ashes upon a board in a rank, and upon every heap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
lay nine spears of crocus.”—(“Medical Superstitions,” Pettigrew,
Philadelphia, Penn., 1844, p. 103.)</p>

<p>We are likewise informed of “the cure of jaundice by the burying
in a dunghill a cake made of ashes and the patient’s urine. Ague in
a boy was cured by a similar cake made of barley-meal and his urine,
and given to a dog to eat; the dog had a shaking fit, and the boy was
cured.”</p>

<p>“Boys were cured of warts by taking an elder-stick and cutting as
many notches in it as there were warts, and then rubbing it upon the
warts, and burying it in a dunghill.”—(Idem, p. 104.)</p>

<p>“Blisters on the tongue are caused by telling fibs. When they
show no disposition to leave, the following process is adopted. Three
small sticks are cut from a tree, each about the length of a finger, and
as thick as a pencil; these are inserted in the mouth, and buried in a
dung-hill; the next day the operation is repeated, as well as on the
third day; after which the three sets of sticks are allowed to remain
in the manure, and as they decay the complaint will disappear.”—(“Folk-Lore
of the Pennsylvania Germans,” Hoffman, p. 28.)</p>

<p>“The following procedure for the cure of bronchitis is still practised
in Berks County. Make a gimlet hole in the door-frame, at the exact
height of the patient’s head, into which insert a small tuft of his hair,
and close the hole with a peg of wood; then cut off the projecting
portion of the peg. As the patient grows in height beyond the peg,
so will the disease be outgrown.”—(Idem, p. 28.)</p>

<p>“Gout may be transferred from a man to a tree, thus: Pare the
nails of the sufferer’s fingers, and clip some hair from his legs. Bore
a hole in an oak, stuff the nails and hair in the hole, stop up the hole
again, and smear it with cow’s dung.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, vol. ii. p. 153, quoting Grimm. Bavaria.)</p>

<p>A curious method of relieving and eradicating all kinds of colic by
“transplantation” is related and described by Schurig. The excrement
voided during one of the paroxysms should be buried in an unfrequented
spot. The grass growing on the soil where the ordure had
been deposited would be eaten by domestic cattle, which would acquire
the disease, relieving the sufferer. “Excrementa tempore paroxysmi
reddita sepeliantur in locum a viatorum frequentia separatum. Gramen
quod enascitur super terram cui stercora commissa fuerint, bovi
vel agno pabuli loco offertur, quod ubi comederit, colica transplantatur
ab homine in brutum, et nunquam ipsum reaffliget.” (Schurig,
“Chylologia,” p. 785.) Other people took the patient’s excrement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
dried it in the open air, mixed it with sweet wine, and gave it to the
sick man to drink. “Sunt qui illud idem exceptum in ære exsiccant,
cum vino edulcorant et patienti propinant.”—(Idem, p. 785.)</p>

<p>Nurses were cautioned not to let the excrement of the babies under
their care touch the hot coals or cinders of the fire; they should throw
all the excrement in at once, or not at all. If we are to understand
that this excrement was to be habitually thrown into the kitchen fire, a
most charming idea is conveyed of the Arcadian simplicity of European
life several centuries back.</p>

<p>“Hoc loco monendæ quoque sunt nutrices vel aliæ mulierculæ infantulis
administrantes ne infantum excrementibus contegat, aut post
modum omnia simul in ignem projiciunt. Exinde enim plurima symptomata
exoriri solent.”—(Schurig, p. 995.)</p>

<p>The case is cited of a physician suffering from marasmus, or emaciation.
“He took an egg and boiled it hard in his own urine; he
then with a bodkin perforated the shell in many places and buried it in
an ant-hill, where it was to be kept to be devoured by the emmets; and
as they wasted the egg he found his distemper to abate.”—(Pettigrew,
“Med. Superstitions,” p. 102.)</p>

<p>“Among medical men ... the Galenist of much repute, of whom
Boyle writes, was induced, when other means of cure failed, to boil an
egg in his own urine. The egg was afterwards buried in an ant-hill,
and as the egg wasted the physician found his distemper go and his
strength increase. In Staffordshire a correspondent says that to cure
jaundice a bladder is often filled with the patient’s urine and placed
near the fire; as the water dries up the jaundice goes, and, were it
necessary, other instances could be given of this superstition.”—(Black,
“Folk-Medicine,” p. 56.)</p>

<p>The following “sympathetic” cure is from Steller’s “Kamtchatka”
(pp. 362 and 367): When a man is suffering from incontinence of
urine, a wreath is made of the soft herb “eheu;” in the centre of this
some fish-spawn is placed, and then the sufferer makes his water upon
it.—(Translated by Mr. Bunnemeyer.)</p>

<p>Ordure alone or mixed with urine, made into a sausage by being put
into a hog’s bladder, and hung up in the chimney, was of “magical
use” in the treatment of yellow jaundice. Christian Franz Paullini’s
own son was cured by mixing his own ordure with asses’ urine in this
manner. The following are some of the extracts from Schurig referred
to in this paragraph: “Ab Incantatione introductis doloribus externe
impositum sulphur hoc occidentale magni usus esse dicitur.... Alii<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
addunt allium, atque elapsis post impositionem viginti quatuor horis
fumo culinari hæc committunt.... Contra ejusmodi dolores a veneficio
alliis placent cataplasmata ex stercore maleficiati in vesicam
porcinam injecto et in Caminum ad suffumigandum suspenso....
In veneficio arcendo notum est, quod stercus humanum sit magni
usus si scilicet parti ex veneficio dolenti applicetur stercus humanum
vel solum, vel cum allio, vel asafœtida; sic enim est ut
alii qui perpetravit veneficium sapiant omnia stercus humanum et
allium, adeo ut necessum habeant solvere veneficium.... Pro icteri
cura magica stercus, vel perse, vel cum urina mixtum, vesicæ suillæ
indunt atque in camino suspendunt, Christianus Franciscus Paullini
cujusdam meminit, qui filii sui icterici stercus cum urina asini commixtum
modo tractavit.”—(Schurig, “Chylologia,” pp. 787, 788.)</p>

<p>When cures were to be effected by the method called by some authors
“insemination” each disease seemed to require its special plant.
Thus yellow jaundice required swallow-wort and juniper berries;
dropsy, absinthe (worm-wood) and box-elder; pleurisy, the poppy;
the plague, the plant known as scordium (this plant smells like garlic),
etc.—(Frommann, “Tract. de Fascinat.,” p. 1030.)</p>

<p>The following problem is presented for solution or for such explanation
as competent scholars may find it possible to give.</p>

<p>We know that every disease was looked upon as an infliction from
some angry god; on the other hand, we know also that for each disease
there was some god, in later days some saint, to whom the afflicted
might appeal; we know also that certain plants were sacred to certain
divinities. Therefore the question to be answered is, Were the plants
hereinbefore specified those which were sacred to those gods who had
charge of those diseases respectively? The examination to be complete
should include all that may now survive among European peasantry
of the worship of Roman, Phœnician, Celtic, Teutonic, or even
Egyptian or Etruscan, deities.</p>

<p>Grimm recites the names of the trees employed for the cure of different
diseases,—epilepsy, peach-blossoms; ague, elder-tree; gout, fir-tree;
ague, willow; gout, young pine-tree.—(“Teut. Mythology.”)</p>

<p>Why was Apollo supposed to love the laurel and the cornel cherry,
“Pluto the cypress and the maiden-hair,—a moisture-loving fern,
which we may take for granted could not be very plentiful in his
chosen realm,—Luna the dittany, Ceres the daffodil, Jupiter the oak,
Minerva the olive, Bacchus the vine, and Venus the myrtle-shade?”—(Extract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
from an article entitled “Flowers as Emblems,” in
“Standard,” London, copied in “Sun,” New York, May 12, 1889.)</p>

<p>“A sick man’s perspiration from the brow wiped off with bread, and
given to a dog, will cure the patient.”—(Sagen-Märchen, “Volksaberglauben
aus Schwaben,” Freiburg, 1861, p. 494.)</p>

<p>As a certain cure for witchcraft take the excrement of the patient,
put it in a pig’s bladder, and hang it up in the chimney; or let him
take some of his own excrement, inwardly, dissolved in vinegar;
or apply human excrement to the bewitched part, then put that excrement
in a pig’s bladder, and hang it up in the chimney to smoke
for three or four days.—(Paullini, pp. 260, 261.)</p>

<p>By the French, urine was considered a certain cure for fever. Such
an amount of superstition attached to the panacea that the prescription
may well be given in full:—</p>

<p>“Knead a small loaf with urine voided in the worst stage of his
fever by a person having the quaternary ague. Bake the loaf, let it
cool, and give it to be eaten by another person. Repeat the same
during three different attacks, and the fever will leave the patient and
go to the person who has eaten the bread.”</p>

<p>Another one runs in these terms:—</p>

<p>“Take an egg, boil it hard, and break off the shell. Prick the egg
in different places with a needle, steep it in the urine of a person
afflicted with fever, and then give it to a man if the patient be a man,
to a woman if a woman, and the recipient will acquire the fever, which
will abandon the patient.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>This remedy Thiers traces back to the Romans, quoting from Horace
in support of his assertion.</p>

<p>The second recipe finds its parallel in the “Chinook olives,” described
in the first pages of this work.</p>

<p>The fact that human ordure was the panacea by which all the effects
of witchcraft could be undone, and all charms and incantations frustrated,
can easily be shown from the citations to be found in Schurig.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
“Occidental sulphur,” applied externally to the pains occasioned by
incantations was said to be very efficacious. Others added garlic, and
twenty-four hours after exposed the mixture to the smoke of the
kitchen-fire. Others again took the ordure of the bewitched person,
made sausage of it, and hung it up to be smoked in the kitchen-fire.</p>

<p>Various instances are given of the efficacy of human ordure in undoing
the work of witches; it was to be applied alone or mixed with
garlic or assafœtida.</p>

<p>Take a liver, cut in pieces, and secretly place in the urinal of the
patient; if the patient unconsciously use the chamber for defecation
he will recover—(“Sagen-Märchen, Volksaberglauben,” etc., Drs. Birlinger
and Buck, p. 481.)</p>

<p>The method of curing fevers by imbedding clippings of the finger
and toe nails of the patient in wax and affixing to another person’s
door-post, is mentioned by Pliny (lib. xxxviii. c. 24).</p>

<p>The same are given, with the others already noted, by Frommann.—(“Tractatus
de Fascinatione,” p. 1003 <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>Etmuller says that the oak was the tree most highly commended;
to secure a good set of teeth, one of the milk teeth was buried in an
oak; to restore falling hair, some of the patient’s hair; to cure gout,
some of his toe-nail clippings, etc.—(Etmuller, vol. i. p. 127.)</p>

<p>“In Donegal, the sufferer should seek a straw with nine knees, and
cut the knots that form the joints of every one of them, any superfluous
knots being thrown away; then bury the knot in a midden or
dung-heap; and as the joints rot, so will the warts.”—(“Folk-Medicine,”
p. 57.)</p>

<p>Grose says, “To cure warts, steal a piece of beef from a butcher’s
shop and rub your warts with it; then throw it down the necessary-house,
or bury it; and as the beef rots, your warts will decay.”—(Brand,
“Pop. Ant.” vol. iii. p. 276, art. “Physical Charms.”)</p>

<p>The American cures for warts in which the sufferer is enjoined to
steal a piece of meat, etc., are a perfect “survival” from the above,
while the “cure” given by Mark Twain, in his story of “Huckleberry
Finn”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Barley-corn, barley-corn, Indian meal shorts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spunk water, spunk water, swallow these warts,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">may be classed as a “distorted survival.”</p>

<p>“A piece of meat is cut from one of the arms of the menaced man
(i. e. menaced with death), and a lock of hair from the opposite side of
his head, and cast into the fire; and he is rubbed with artemisia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
dipped in water, as this plant is the food of the ghosts. These rites,
omitting the cutting of the flesh and hair, must be performed on four
successive nights.”—(“Death and Funeral Customs among the Omahas,”
Francis La Flesche, in “Jour. of Amer. Folk-Lore,” Jan.-March,
1889, p. 4.)</p>

<p>“The Orkney islanders will wash a sick person and then throw the
water down a gateway in the belief that the sickness will leave the
patient and be transferred to the first person who passes through
the gate.”—(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. ii. p. 153.)</p>

<p>These cures by “transplantation” are still to be found in full vigor
among the descendants of the immigrants from Westphalia and the
Palatinate who made their homes in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>For the cure of jaundice: “Hollow out a carrot, fill it with the patient’s
urine, and hang it, by means of a string, in the fireplace. As
the urine is evaporated, and the carrot becomes shrivelled, the disease
will leave the patient. In this there is an evident belief in the connection
between the properties and color of the carrot and the yellow skin
of the patient having jaundice. To this class may belong the belief
respecting the use of a band of red flannel for diphtheria, and yellow or
amber beads for purulent discharges from the ears.”—(“Folk-Med. of
the Penn’a Germans,” Hoffman, Amer. Phil. Society, 1889.)</p>

<p>Reference should be had to Black’s notes upon a similar custom in
Staffordshire, where, instead of a carrot, a bladder is filled.—(“Folk-Medicine,”
p. 56.)</p>

<p>“Convulsions in a child are sometimes due to the influence of the
fairies.” Mooney describes a cure effected by a mother who “picked
from the roadside ten small white pebbles, known as ‘fairy stones.’
On reaching home, she put nine of these stones into a vessel of urine
and threw the tenth into the fire. She also put into the vessel some
chicken-dung and three sprigs of a plant (probably ivy or garlic) which
grew on the roof above the door. She then stripped the child and
threw into the fire the shirt and other garments which were worn next
the skin. The child was then washed from head to foot, wrapped in a
blanket and put to bed. There were nine hens and a rooster on the
rafters above the door. In a short time the child had a violent fit and
the nine hens dropped dead upon the floor. The rooster dropped down
from his perch, crew three times, and then flew again to the rafters.
If the woman had put the tenth stone with the others, he would have
dropped dead with the hens. The child was cured.”—(“Med. Mythol.
of Ireland,” James Mooney, “Amer. Phil. Soc.” 1887.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span></p>

<p>Mooney remarks upon the above: “This single instance combines
in itself a number of important features in connection with the popular
mythology; the dung, the urine, the plant above the door, the
chickens, the fire and the garment worn next the skin, and introduces
also a new element into the popular theory of disease, viz.: the idea
of vicarious cure, or rather of vicarious sacrifice. This belief, which
is general, is that no one can be cured of a dangerous illness, unless, as
the people express it, ‘something is left in its place’ to suffer the sickness
and death.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>In the case of a “changeling child,” the mother was ordered to leave
it “on the dung-hill to cry and not to pity it.”—(Hazlitt’s edition of
“Fairy Tales,” London, 1875, p. 372.)</p>

<p>“At Sucla-Tirtha, in India, an earthen pot containing the accumulated
sins of the people, is annually set adrift on the river.”—(“The

<span class="smaller">THE USE OF THE LINGAM IN INDIA.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In connection with the Lingamic ritual in India, there remain usages
now degenerated into symbolism, which cannot be interpreted in
any other sense than as “survivals” of very obscene and disgusting
practices in the primitive life of that region. In describing the sacrifice
called Poojah, Maurice says: “The Abichegam makes a part of
the Poojah. This ceremony consists in pouring milk upon the lingam.
This liquor is afterwards kept with great care, and some drops are
given to dying people that they may merit the delights of the Calaison.”
The “salagram of the Vishnuites is the same as the lingam of the
Seevites.” “Happy are those favored devotees who can quaff the
sanctified water in which either has been bathed.”—(“Ind. Ant.”
vol. v. pp. 146, 179.)</p>

<p>Dulaure describes the rites of the Cochi-couris, in which the sacred
water of the Ganges is first poured upon the lingam; it is then preserved
to be dealt out in drops to the faithful; it is specially serviceable
in soothing the last hours of the dying. The Lingam is the
Phallic symbol. The water or milk sanctified by it may represent a
former employment of urine, such, as will be shown, as prevailed all over
Europe. The use of lingam water is perhaps analogous to that of
mistletoe water, previously noted.</p>

<p>In speaking of the “mysteries” of the goddess “Cotitta,” a popular
Venus of the isle of Chios, Dulaure says: “Les initiés, qui se livraient
à tous les excès de la débauche, y employaient le Phallus d’une
manière particulière; ils étaient de verre et servaient de vases à boire.”
He quotes Juvenal, satire 2, verse 95, as saying of the extreme license
of these mysteries: “vitreo bibit ille Priapo.”—(“Des Divinités
Génératrices.”)</p>

<p>Does not the preceding paragraph, in the lines from the Roman
satirist, conceal under a very gauzy veil, a dirty proceeding akin to the
urine dance of the Zuñis?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span></p>

<p>Frommann quotes the above lines from Juvenal, without attempting
to enter upon an explanation of them. (See “Tract. de Fascinatione,”
p. 333.) Rev. Lewis Evans, a Fellow of Wadham’s College, Oxford,
translates them as follows in his edition of “Juvenal:”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Another drains a Priapus-shaped glass.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Gifford renders it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Swill from huge glasses of immodest mould.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Montfaucon says that in the Festivals of Priapus “celebrated by the
women ... the priestess sprinkles Priapus with water.”—(“l’Antiquité
expliquée,” lib. i. part 2, c. xxviii.; in the first volume is a representation
of a phallic vase with human ears attached.)</p>

<p>“Verser quelques gouttes sur la tête dans la bouche des agonisants.”—(Dulaure,
“Des. Div. Generat.,” Paris, 1825, pp. 105, 106, 111.)</p>

<p>“In a manuscript of the church of Beauvais about the year 500, it is
said that the chanter and canons shall stand before the gates of the
church, which were shut, holding each of them urns full of wine with
glass cups, of whom one canon shall begin the Kalends of January.”—(Fosbroke,
“British Monachism,” p. 81.)</p>

<p>In out of the way nooks and corners in Europe, intelligent observers
may still stumble upon traces of the religious observances alluded
to in Juvenal; Mr. Macaulay, of Philadelphia, Penn’a, who lived for a
time near Monaco, in the Riviera, imparts the information that, in
that section of Italy he had personally noticed such a peculiar custom;
i. e. that of assembling each family on Christmas eve, in a semicircle,
round the fire; the youngest boy urinated on the blazing log; then the
father took a glass goblet, filled with white wine, and sprinkled the
log with an olive branch; finally, all sipped from the goblet, the contents
of which Mr. Macaulay said he had been told were undoubtedly
symbolical of urine.</p>

<p>Among people farther to the north, the same worship of fire by offering
food and drinking a libation still obtains without any offensive
features.</p>

<p>In Sweden and Norway “early in the morning, the good wife has
been up, making her fire and baking; she now assembles her servants
in a half-circle before the oven door, they all bend the knee, take one
bit of cake, and drink the fire’s health; what is left of cake or drink is
cast into the flame.”—(Grimm, “Teut. Mythol.” vol. ii. p. 629.)</p>

<p>“Our German sagen and märchen have retained the feature of kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
before the oven and praying to it.... The unfortunate, the persecuted,
resort to the oven and bewail their woe, they reveal to it some
secret which they dare not confess to the world.”—(Idem, p. 629.)</p>

<p>“A leur Coleda, les Serbes font brûler une bûche de chêne, l’arrosent
de vin, la frappent en faisant voler les étincelles, et crient: ‘Autant
d’étincelles, autant de chèvres et de brebis.’”—(“Les Primitifs,”
Réclus, p. 111.)</p>

<p>The resemblance to the customs of the East Indies was, in places,
even closer than as above indicated.</p>

<p>Inman tells of sterile women who drank “priapic wine,” i. e. wine
poured upon an upright conical stone representing the lingam, and then
collected and allowed to turn sour.—(Inman, “Ancient Faiths,” etc.,
vol. i. p. 305, article “Asher.”)</p>

<p>The same statement is to be found in Hargrave Jennings’ work,
“Phallicism,” London, 1884, p. 256, but it seems to be repeated from
Inman and Dulaure. Campbell reports that “among the principal
relics of the Church at Embrun was the statue of Saint Foutin. The
worshippers of this idol poured libations of wine upon its extremity,
which was reddened by the practice. This wine was caught in a jar
and allowed to turn sour. It was then called ‘holy vinegar,’ and was
used by the women as a lotion to anoint the yoni.”—(“Phallic Worship,”
Robert Allen Campbell, St. Louis, Mo., 1888, p. 197.)</p>

<p>Among the Apache Indians of Arizona, the Zuñis, Moquis, and Pueblos,
the author has seen large arrow or spear shaped pieces of flint
which had been obtained under peculiar circumstances, were regarded
as possessed of great virtues, and were worn round the necks by the
women, generally by those who professed “medicine” powers. Fragments
of these flints were ground to fine powder, and administered to
women while pregnant, to ensure safe delivery; all that was learned of
these stones will be presented in another work; the veneration paid
them seems to be closely associated with the worship of lightning.
Vallencey, in his “Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis,” No. xiii. 17,
says: “In the Highlands of Scotland, a large chrystal, of a figure
somewhat oval, was kept by the priests to work charms by; water
poured upon it at this day is given to cattle against diseases; these
stones are now preserved by the oldest and most superstitious in the
country.”—(Brand, “Pop. Antiq.” vol. iii. p. 60, art. “Sorcerer.”)</p>

<p>Among the peasantry of Ireland there are in use certain prehistoric
arrow-heads, believed by them to be fairy darts.
“When an illness is supposed to be due to the influence of the fairies,
... this ‘fairy dart’ ... is put into a tumbler and covered with
water, which the patient then drinks, and if the fairies are responsible
for his sickness, he at once recovers.”—(“Medical Mythology of Ireland,”
Mooney, Amer. Phil. Soc., 1887.)</p>

<p>And in like manner,—as has already been shown of the sacred
character attaching, among the people of the far East, to water, wine,
or milk which had been poured over the lingam,—the women of
France solaced themselves with the hope that children would come to
those who drank an infusion containing scrapings from the phalli,
existing until the outbreak of the French revolution, at Puy en Velay,
in the church of Saint Foutin, in the shrine of Saint Guerlichon, near
Bruges, in the shrine of Guignolles, near Brest; and in that of an

</div>

<p>A new task now presents itself, the examination into burlesque
survivals of rites and usages no longer countenanced as matters
of religious importance.</p>

<p>Religion is not content with being tenacious of its ceremonial; it
often goes so far as to sanctify reversions to usages and modes of
thought which have passed out of the recollection of the people; in
doing this, it is frequently necessary that some explanation be invented,
as the hierophants themselves are generally ignorant of the
true reasons for their conduct; but more ordinarily mankind accepts
and complies with ritualistic precepts without inquiry, and even with
a vague belief that the more archaic a practice may be, the more
efficacy it must necessarily have in securing protection and good
fortune.</p>

<p>The Hindu festival of Holi, Huli, or Hulica, familiar to most readers,
has thus been outlined by a recent witness as celebrated in the
provinces near Oudeypore.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The proceedings are characterized as
saturnalia, attended with much freedom and excessive drunkenness:</p>

<p>“The importance of the study of popular traditions, though recognized
by men of science, is not yet understood by the general public.
It is evident, however, that the mental tokens which belong to one
intellectual stock, which bear the stamp of successive ages, which connect
the intelligence of our day with all periods of human activity, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
worthy of serious consideration. Much of this time-honored currency
is rude and shapeless, it may be ore scarcely marked by the die; but
among the treasures silver and gold are not wanting. An American
superstition may require for its explanation reference to Teutonic mythology,
or may be directly associated with the philosophy, monuments,
and arts of Hellas.... It is, however, now a recognized
principle that higher forms can only be comprehended by the help of
the lower forms out of which they grew.... The only truly scientific
habit of mind is that wide and generous spirit of modern research
which, without disdain and without indifference, embraces all aspects
of human thought, and endeavors in all to find a whole.”—(Prof. W.
W. Newell, in “Journal of American Folk-Lore,” Jan.-March, 1889.)</p>

<p>“It is not too much to assert, once for all, that meaningless customs
must be survivals; that they had a practical, or at least ceremonial
intention when and where they first arose; but are now fallen into
absurdity from having been carried on in a new state of society,
where their original sense has been discarded.”—(“Primitive Culture,”
E. B. Tylor, New York, 1874, vol. i. p. 85.)</p>

<p>“I believe that no custom which we find among early races was
initiated without some very good reason why, though those who practise
it may long have lost it, and even have been obliged to invent a
new one, utterly different from the original, to explain the rite which
they ignorantly practise.”—(Personal letter from J. W. Kingsley,
Esq., M. D., Brome Hall, Scole, England.)</p>

<p>“The serious business of ancient society may be seen to sink into
the sport of later generations, and its serious belief to linger on in
nursery folk-lore, while superseded habits of old-world life may be
modified into new-world forms, still powerful for good and evil.”—(“Primitive
Culture,” E. B. Tylor, London, 1871, vol. i. p. 15.)</p>

<p>And again: “Religion holds on, with the tenacity of superstition,
to all that has ever been practised.”—(“Custom and Myth,” Andrew
Lang, New York, 1885, p. 241.)</p>

<p>A brighter light will be thrown upon future investigations by regarding
folk-lore and folk-usage, especially folk-medicine, as the crystalization
of primordial religious thought and practice.</p>

<p>“It can hardly be too often repeated, since it is not yet generally
recognized, that, in spite of their fragmentary character, the popular
superstitions and customs of the peasantry are by far the fullest and
most trustworthy evidence we possess as to the primitive religion of
the Aryans. Indeed, the primitive Aryan, in all that regards his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
mental fibre and texture, is not extinct. He is amongst us to this
day. The great intellectual and moral forces which have revolutionized
the educated world, have scarcely affected the peasant. In his
inmost beliefs, he is what his forefathers were in the days when forest
trees still grew, and squirrels played on the ground where Rome and
London now stand.</p>

<p>“Hence every inquiry into the primitive religion of the Aryans should
either start from the superstitious beliefs and observances of the
peasantry, or should at least be constantly checked and controlled by
reference to them. Compared with the evidence afforded by living
tradition, the testimony of ancient books on the subject of ancient
religion is worth very little. For literature accelerates the advance of
thought at a rate which leaves the slow progress of opinion by word
of mouth at an immeasurable distance behind. Two or three generations
of literature may do more to change thought than two or three
thousand years of traditional life. But the mass of the people, who
do not read books, remain unaffected by the mental revolution wrought
by literature; and so it has come about that in Europe, at the present
day, the superstitious beliefs and practices which have been handed
down by word of mouth are generally of a far more archaic type
than the religion depicted in the most ancient literature of the Aryan
race.”—(“The Golden Bough,” James G. Frazer, M. A., London,
1890, Preface, viii, ix.)</p>

<p>The people of Rangoon, Siam, observe a peculiar usage at the time
of their New Year. Every man, woman, boy, or girl is armed with a
“squirt-gun,” with which all people on the street are drenched.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Elliott, apparently quoting from Zagoskin (a Russian explorer,
<i>temp.</i> 1843), says that the Alaskans have “entertainments” in the
“kashga.” “It sometimes happens, on these occasions, that lovers
of fun sprinkle the women with oil, or with that fluid which they use
in place of soap, squirted from small bladders concealed about their
persons, and such jokes are never resented.”—(“Our Arctic Province,”
Henry W. Elliott, New York, 1887, p. 392.)</p>

<p>“From the very beginning effigies of the most revolting indecency are
set up in the gates of the town and in the principal thoroughfares.</p>

<p>“Troops of men and women, wreathed with flowers and drunk with
bang, crowd the streets, carrying sacks full of a bright red vegetable
powder. With this they assail the passers-by, covering them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
clouds of dust, which soon dyes their clothes a startling color. Groups
of people standing at the windows retaliate with the same projectile, or
squirt with <i>wooden syringes red and yellow streams of water into the
streets below</i>.”</p>

<p>The Nautch dances reach the acme of voluptuousness, and the accompanying
chants are filled with suggestiveness. The author here
quoted says that Holica was the Indian Venus.</p>

<p>An eminent authority says that “this red powder (<i>gulàl</i>) is a sign of
a bad design of an adulterous character. During the holi holidays the
Maharaj throws <i>gulàl</i> on the breasts of female and male devotees, and
directs the current of some water of a yellow color from a syringe upon
the breasts of females.”—(Inman, “Ancient Faiths embodied in
Ancient Names,” p. 393.)</p>

<p>This “yellow water” may be a survival of and a refinement upon
urine. The Apaches and Navajoes, close neighbors of the Zuñis, have
had until very recently (and may still celebrate) the dance of the
Joshkân, in which clowns scatter upon the spectators, from bladders
wound round their bodies, water, said to be representative of urine.</p>

<p>Among the Aztecs there was a festival allowing the fullest license to
clowns, armed with bladders filled with red powder or fine pieces of
maguey paper attached by strings to short poles. With these bladders
all persons caught in the streets, especially women and girls, were
mercilessly buffeted.—(Sahagun, vol. ii. in Kingsborough’s “Mexican
Antiquities,” vol. vi. p. 33, and again vol. vii. p. 83.)</p>

<p>His account says that in the seventeenth month, which was called
“Tititl,” and corresponded almost to our winter solstice, the Mexican
year being divided into eighteen months of twenty days each, beginning
with our February, the Aztec populace played a game called
“nechichiquavilo.”</p>

<p>All the men and boys who wished to play this game made little bags
or nets, filled with the pollen of the rush, called “espadaña,” or with
paper cut in fine pieces. These were attached to cords or ribbons half
a yard long, in such a manner that a blow could be struck with them.
Others made these bags like gloves, which they stuffed as above stated,
or with leaves of green maize. No one was allowed, under penalty, to
put into these bags any stones, or anything else which could hurt.</p>

<p>The boys at once began to play this game, in the way of a sham-battle,
hitting each other on the head, or wherever else they could.
As the fun increased the more mischievous of the boys began to beat
the young maidens passing along the street. At times three or four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
young boys would attack one girl, and beat her so hard as to weary her
and make her cry. The more prudent of the young girls, in going from
point to point, carried a club with which to defend themselves. Some
of the boys concealed the bag, and when any old women carelessly
approached they would suddenly begin to beat them, crying out,
“Chichiquatzinte mantze!”—which means, “Our mother, this is
the bag of the game!”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The following is Torquemada’s description:—</p>

<p>“In the festival in honor of the goddess Yamatecuhtli, or “principal
old woman,” in the seventeenth month of the Mexican calendar, all the
people of the city made bags after the manner of purses, and stuffed them
full of hay and straw and other things, which would have no weight
and do no harm, and, attaching them to a cord, carried them hidden
under their cloaks. With these bags they buffeted all the women they
met on the street.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>—(Torquemada, “Monarchia Indiana,” lib. x.
cap. 29.)</p>

<p>He recognizes the similarity between this and the blind-man’s-buff
games of other countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span></p>

<p>A contributor to “Asiatic Researches” calls this powder of the
Huli festival a “purple powder,” and claims that the idea is to represent
the return of spring, which the Romans call “purple.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>In some parts of North America the 1st of April is observed like
Saint Valentine’s Day, with this difference, that the boys are allowed
to chastise the girls, if they think fit, either with words or blows.—(Brand,
“Popular Antiquities,” vol. i. p. 141, article “April Fool’s
Day.”)</p>

<h3>A FEW REMARKS UPON THE USE OF BLADDERS IN RELIGIOUS
CEREMONIES.</h3>

<p>Whether or not primitive man, excited by his insatiate, omnivorous
appetite for gods, under the impulses of which he deified winds, waters,
trees, and stones, and looked with a veneration not far removed from devotion
itself, upon the holy graals, chalices, and other paraphernalia of
his ritual, should have associated a mysterious power with the bladders
he employed to hold his urine and ordure is a question which no one
can to-day determine.</p>

<p>For our own cow-worshipping Aryan ancestry bladders were a natural
means of transporting liquids, exactly as they remain among the Apaches
and other Indian tribes of America.</p>

<p>Introduced of necessity into religious ceremonial, they would, with
the advance of years, and in spite of the improvement which might be
brought about in the domestic comfort of the people at large, gain
a certain “medicine” value, strictly parallel to that which we know
has been gained by the gourd-rattle, which, in not a few cases, has
been consulted as an oracle, and adored as a god.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The author has observed a number of instances of the use by Sioux,
Apache, and other Indians, of bladders tied in the hair as an “ornament”
long after traders had placed within reach glass beads, feathers,
and other means of decoration. The Hottentots kept drinking-water
in “the intestines of animals.”—(Thurnberg, in Pinkerton, vol. xvi.
pp. 38, 73, 141.)</p>

<p>Of the Patagonians we are informed that “the only vessels they
use for carrying water are bladders.”—(“Adventure and Beagle,”
vol. i. p. 93.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span></p>

<p>We are informed that the Shamans of Alaska throw into the sea
inflated bladders and watch them sink, as a means of divination.—(“Our
Arctic Province,” Elliott, p. 393.)</p>

<p>In some parts of rural England there were kept up even to our own
day certain feasts or ceremonies, connected with the ploughing of the
land. These “fool-plough” days varied in different sections from
early in January to Shrove Tuesday. They partook of the nature
of a frolic, the plough being driven by a clown armed with a bladder,
with which he urged his team. There were certain peculiarities connected
with this custom indicative of a Pagan origin. The clown
was attired as a woman, there was music, the plough was drawn
three times round a fire, the blacksmith received “sharping corn”
for sharpening the plough-irons, and the whole ended with feasting,
in which the cock figured as one of the articles of food. All this suggested
to the writer in Brand a relationship with the “Compitalia” of
the Romans and “the three sacred ploughings” of the Athenians; also
the sacred ceremonial ploughing of the Chinese.—(Brand, “Popular
Antiquities,” vol. i. pp. 505 <i>et seq.</i>, article “Fool-Ploughs.”)</p>

<p>Bruce describes the commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian army on
an expedition against the Gallas while in the act of making his toilet.
“A man was then finishing his head-dress by plaiting it with some of
the long and small guts of an ox, which I did not perceive had ever
been cleaned.”—(Bruce, “Nile,” vol. iv. p. 212.)</p>

<p>The Gallas of Abyssinia, upon slaughtering an ox, “hang the entrails
round their necks, or interweave them with their hair.”—(Maltebrun,
“Un. Geography,” Boston, 1847, vol. ii. p. 47, article
“Abyssinia.”)</p>

<p>Bruce describes a chief of the Gallas as having “his long hair plaited
and interwoven with the bowels of oxen, and so knotted and twisted together
as to render it impossible to distinguish the hair from the bowels....
He had likewise a wreath of guts hung about his neck, and several
rounds of the same about his middle.”—(“Nile,” vol. iv. p. 560.)</p>

<p>“Their favorite ornament is composed of the entrails of their oxen,
which, without superfluous care in cleansing them, are plaited in the
hair and tied as girdles round the waist.”—(“Encyc. of Geog.,” Philadelphia,
1855, vol. ii. p. 588, article “Abyssinia.”)</p>

<p>“A Norwegian witch has boasted of sinking a ship by opening a bag
in which she had shut up a wind. Ulysses received the winds in a
leather bag from Æolus, king of the winds.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, vol. i. p. 27.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span></p>

<p>An examination of the examples just adduced, as well as of those
introduced under “Cures by Transplantation,” would seem to show
that bladders were used in preference to material just as available and
convenient, and that when a substitution was made it was always by a
horn or a glass, clear as the entrail which it no doubt was supposed to
resemble. The god Crepitus, as we have shown, was symbolized as a
swollen paunch. The clowns of the circuses of the present day are
armed with bladders; but why no antiquarian has yet arisen to explain
to us.</p>

<p>Brand (“Popular Antiquities,” vol. i. p. 261 <i>et seq.</i>, article “Fools”)
contains no information on this point.</p>

<p>The use of the bladder is to be noted in the festivals of the Inuits.
“Après un superbe vacarme, ils suspendent à des cordes une centaine
des vessies, prises à des animaux tous tués à coups de flèche.”—(“Les
Primitifs,” Réclus, p. 110, “Les Inoits Occidentaux.”)</p>

<p>The explanation given by Réclus is as follows: “Faut-il expliquer
que les vessies, échauffées par la flamme, symbolisent les souffles du
printemps?... Qu’elles symbolisent l’esprit de vie qui entre dans les
narines?”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>It may be enough to point out the care with which these bladders
must be selected; not every bladder will do,—only those from animals
killed with arrows.</p>

</div>

<p>Only such matter has been admitted into this volume as could
<i>prima facie</i> be considered as having the right of entry; the greatest
care has been taken to avoid distortion or mutilation of authorities,
and much has been excluded that might have been presented without
running a risk of being accused of unfairness.</p>

<p>For example, as old an authority as John de Laet calls attention to
the great prevalence of intoxication and debauchery among the Indians
of Vextipa, near Mexico, who on feast days had the ancient custom of
becoming drunk as beasts and committing enormous excesses.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> And in
like manner the first missionaries in Canada complained of the brutal
orgies of the natives, in which, under cover of darkness and the cloak of
their superstitions, deeds were committed which the pen dared not describe.
Ample reference to these has been preserved in the Jesuit relations,
and in the exact and interesting American treatises dependent so
largely upon them.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It is more likely, however, that the Huron and
Algonkin saturnalia were, in general terms, scenes of promiscuous
licentiousness.</p>

<p>Only two authorities can be cited, Fathers Le Jeune and Sagard, who
instance the use of human urine or ordure under spiritual direction; all
others leave the inference that the bacchanalia of which they were the
reluctant and disgusted observers had no other peculiarity than that of
unrestrained sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a better example of the tenacity of superstition
than that which the subjoined extract from the “Evening
Star,” of Washington, D. C., shows as existing under our own noses.</p>

<p class="center">“A CURIOUS HUNGARIAN SUPERSTITION.</p>

<p>“A correspondent of the ‘Philadelphia Press,’ at Pottsville, Pa., tells
of a curious scene he witnessed in the Hungarian quarter. A number
of children were running round barefooted, beating tin pans and boxes.
In the midst of the circle they were describing was a live baby buried
up to the neck in the cold ground with a shawl wound round its throat
for protection. It was learned that the object of putting the baby in
this peculiar position was to cure it of a skin disease, the Huns having
the same faith in the curative properties of mother earth that is characteristic
of many savage tribes.</p>

<p>“While the child was thus experiencing the medicinal virtues of the
earth packed round its body, the boys beat upon the pans in order to
frighten away the evil spirit that had caused the disease.”</p>
</div>

<p>A retrospective glance at the long list of excrementitious remedies
collected shows that both the disease to be treated and the remedy by
which the cure was to be effected were regarded as entirely beyond the
domain of human science. Even in these cases, where medicines, pure
and simple, as we should now recognize them, were to be administered,
there was a complication of mysterious mummery and ceremony, the
first vestige of the former power of the medicine-man. Thus felons
could be treated by tracing a circle round them with a dead man’s
bone; but the circle, we should remember, was pre-eminently the line
of magic.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Teeth were worn as amulets, or given as medicine in disease, but it
was essential that they should be drawn from the jaw before the burial
of the body; or that they should be the first shed by a child; that
they should be those of a man who had died a violent death; or that
they should be caught before they touched the ground.</p>

<p>If they were not to be used immediately, they were not to be carried
about, but were to be buried in the bark of a tree.</p>

<p>The skull of a man was a remedy for the diseases of men only; that
of a woman, for those of the female sex.</p>

<p>There were combinations of numbers; no medicine was to be administered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
an even number of times; of color<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> based upon the doctrine of
signatures which taught among other things, that red medicines cured
red diseases, and saffron-tinted ones, those of the jaundice type. There
were iron-clad formulæ for gathering medicinal plants in which the
hour of the day, the season of the year, the age of the moon, the position
of the planets, the hand to be used in plucking, the silence to be
observed, were all sedulously inculcated and enjoined.</p>

<p>There were charms and counter-charms, such as the Dea-soil and
the Badershin of the Druids, in which the same magical incantation,
used in different manners, i. e. going with or against the sun, induced
contrary results.</p>

<p>Traces of all these superstitious ideas are to be looked for in<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
association with the administration of excrementitious remedial agents,
or the incantations in which such agents appear.</p>

<p>The method of curing incontinence of urine by micturating into a
dog kennel probably belongs to the class of the Druidic Badershin or
Widershin, to which also we might be able to refer, did we know more
about it, the very ancient and widely-disseminated charact or charm,
“Diabolus effodiat,” etc.</p>

<p>Thus, in making use of lion-dung, it was recommended that it should
be that of a lioness which had brought forth young; and, to continue
the subject, we find the dung of black cows, the dung of bulls and
cows “collected in the month of May,” “water of cow-dung collected
in May and June,” etc., specially enjoined in the compounding of
prescriptions.</p>

<p>Questions of the deepest interest spring up like weeds as we re-examine
our text. Of these, it is impossible to enumerate all, or to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
elaborate these remarks into a disquisition upon religio-medical botany;
one or two, however, will be named. Why was hyoscyamus (henbane)
added to human ordure and human urine for the frustration of
witchcraft? Was it because this plant was able to kill the chicken-god
sacred to so many European peoples, and still to be detected upon
the spires of our churches? Was the chicken-god, or to adopt modern
language, was the god of whom the chicken was the symbol, friendly
to witches? Being one of the principal deities of a supplanted cultus,
he must necessarily have been the power, or one of the powers, invoked
by the witches who were the secret adherents of the old order of things
spiritual.</p>

<p>Again, we read that in treating the bewitched, their limbs were
bathed in their own urine; to which, Frommann says, some added
assafœtida and others garlic; but assafœtida was called “merde du Diable.”
(“Bib. Scat.” p. 128.) Was this fetid gum sacred to some god,
and was this dung-god, or were dung-gods in general, the powers to be
invoked for rendering nugatory the assaults of witches?</p>

<p>In our quotations we have shown that, in the opinion of old authors
nothing equalled human ordure for baffling witches, and Luther has
been cited as expressing the belief that Satan fled in dismay from human
flatulence.</p>

<p>This belief has been transplanted to American soil with the German
immigrants settled in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Hoffman speaks of a “quack” who gave a credulous dupe “some
charms and vile-smelling herbs, which he was directed to burn in his
house so as to drive out the evil and remove the visitor” (i. e. the spirit
which was troubling the dupe).—(“Folk-Med. of the Penn’a Germans,”
in Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc. 1889.)</p>

<p>A marked peculiarity of the list of animals is the absence of those
belonging to the fauna of the New World; there is no reference to the
excrement of the turkey, a bird unknown to the nations migrating into
Europe; but there are to be found the names of nearly all the birds
and beasts known to Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Celtic, or Teutonic
races, with, however, some notable exceptions; there is no mention of
the excreta of the bear, the swan, the wren, the parrot, and a few
others; the complete list contained in this work is repeated for
convenience: Hare, camel, goat, wild goat, bull, cow and calf, wolf,
hen, chickens and cock, boar, wild and tame, horse, ass, hippopotamus,
lynx, badger, cuckoo, swallow, cat, hawk, mouse, peacock, pigeon, domestic,
wood-pigeon, turtle dove, raven, sparrow, hedge-hog, dog, ring-dove,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
mule, weasel, stork, vulture, crocodile, starling, eagle, owl,
elephant, goose, lizard, rat, duck, kid, chameleon, quail, kite, rabbit,
deer, magpie, crow, ape, hyena, reindeer, fox, lion, leopard.</p>

<p>A closer examination will discover that the ordure and urine so
prescribed were not to be taken indiscriminately from each and every
animal, but that each was assigned as a remedy appropriate for some
special physical disturbance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, modern knowledge of the medical lore, of the botanical,
mineralogical, and chemical attainments and hagiology of the
ancients is not so thorough that we can venture, with the positiveness
warranted by the suspicion to which a close study of this subject gives
rise, to assert that the dung or urine of a given animal was most suitable
to palliate the pangs of the disease traceable to the offended dignity
of the deity of which the particular animal was the representative
or symbol; but it is a fact deserving of scrutiny that such an association
is unmistakably indicated in a number of cases.</p>

<p>Pliny says that goat-dung could be applied with benefit to ulcers
upon the generative organs. Was not the goat sacred to Pan (i. e.,
was not Pan himself, in primitive days, the deified goat)? And was
not Pan the god to whose care the generative organs were, under
certain circumstances, confided?</p>

<p>When the feet of travellers became blistered, they were bathed
with the urine of asses. Was the ass, the burden-bearer, at any time,
or in any place under the domination of the Romans, regarded as the
god of travellers? Fosbroke says, “An ass carried the utensils and
statues in the sacrifices of Cybele and at the birth of Bacchus, the god
newly born, but he was only sacrificed to Mars or Priapus.”—(“Encyclopædia
of Antiquities,” London, 1843, vol. ii. p. 1009.)</p>

<p>Pliny also prescribed asses’ dung for uterine troubles,—a clear
recognition of the animal’s priapic association.</p>

<p>Hippopotamus-dung was given as a remedy for fever and ague.
This monster pachyderm lives in swamps, which are the hotbeds of
malaria. By a mistaken analogy, the animal would have been credited
with the origin of the disease always to be dreaded by intruders
upon its lair.</p>

<p>Without desiring to enter into unnecessary controversy upon the
meaning of terms, it would seem to be perfectly reasonable to assert
that the majority of the deities of paganism had been zoömorphic
before man’s increasing intellectuality anthropomorphized them, and
relegated the animal first to the subordinate position of being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
head or limbs of the god, and then to the still more ancillary one of
being simply the companion or symbol.</p>

<p>To consider an animal a god, the messenger, attendant, companion,
or representative of that god; to offer it up as the most delectable
sacrifice to that deity, and afterwards restrict the oblation to a part
only of the animal, such as its horns, hoofs, excreta,—are all links in
the same psycho-religious chain of reasoning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fanny D. Bergen shrewdly observes, “There seems to be the
best of reason for believing that, to seek the origin of the popular
delusion concerning the curative properties of certain animal excreta,
we must study the mythology of our long-ago Aryan ancestors.”
And again: “It has often happened that substances, as well as
ceremonies, which originally had a religious signification, in later
ages degenerated into fancied cures for diseases; so it is more than
probable that the employment of animal excreta as remedies among
the less intelligent classes of Europe, in both earlier and later times,
as well as in our own newest offshoot from the Indo-European stem,
is a survival of early Aryan religious observance.”—(“Animal and
Plant Lore,” in Popular Science Monthly, New York, September,
1888.)</p>

<p>“Car, dans la conception vraiment orthodoxe du sacrifice, l’hostie,
qu’elle soit homme, femme ou vierge, agneau ou génisse, coq ou
colombe, représente la divinité elle-même.”—(“Les Primitifs,” Réclus,
p. 366.)</p>

<p>“Our general ignorance of the popular superstitions and customs of
the ancients has already been confessed.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, vol. i. p. 363.)</p>

<p>“Frazer’s remarks make very interesting reading in support of the
theory of Zoötheistic pharmacy. He not only shows that the animals
enumerated in this chapter were the deities in charge of the corn, rye,
and other cereals, but that to them recourse was had for the cure of
wounds, hurts, and aches happening to the reapers during harvest.
In one example the cat which is introduced into the field is made to
lick the laborer’s wounds; in another, the goat—which is decked
with ribbons, and afterwards killed with much ceremony, and eaten at
the end of the harvest—has its skin converted into a cloak, which the
farmer is required to put over his shoulders during the coming harvest
... but if a reaper gets pains in his back, the farmer gives him
the goat-skin to wear.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 16.)</p>

<p>“Amongst the animals whose forms the corn-spirit is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
take, are the wolf, dog, hare, cock, goose, cat, goat, cow (ox), bull, pig,
and horse.” (Idem, vol. ii. p. 1.) “Other animal forms assumed by
the corn-spirit are the stag, roe, sheep, bear, ass, fox, mouse, stork,
swan, and kite.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 33.)</p>

<p>Here we have pretty nearly all our list of animals, and the excrement
of every one here mentioned has been and is used in the prescriptions
of folk-medicine, excepting the excreta of the bear and
swan.</p>

<p>“Remembering that in European folk-lore the pig is a common
embodiment of the corn-spirit, we may now ask, May not the pig,
which was so closely associated with Demeter, be nothing but the goddess
herself in animal form? The pig was sacred to her; in art she
was represented carrying or accompanied by a pig; and the pig was
regularly sacrificed in her mysteries, the reason assigned being that
the pig injures the corn, and is therefore an enemy of the goddess.
But after an animal has been conceived as a god, or a god as an animal,
it sometimes happens, as we have seen, that the god sloughs off
his animal form, and becomes purely anthropomorphic; and that then
the animal, which at first had been slain in the character of the god,
comes to be the victim offered to the god, on the ground of its hostility
to the deity; in short, that the god is sacrificed to himself, on the
ground that he is his own enemy.... As men emerge from savagery,
the tendency to anthropomorphize or humanize their divinities gains
strength.”—(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 360.)</p>

<p>“A man would eat freely of what was regarded as the incarnation
of the god of another man, but the incarnation of his own particular
god he would consider it death to injure or eat. The god was supposed
to avenge the insult by taking up his abode in that person’s
body, and causing to generate there the very thing which he had
eaten, until it produced death.”—(“Samoa,” Turner, p. 17.)</p>

<p>“The ram was Ammon himself. On the monuments, it is true,
Ammon appears in semi-human form, with the body of a man, and the
head of a ram. But this only shows that he was in the usual chrysalis
state through which beast-gods regularly pass before they emerge
as full-fledged anthropomorphic gods.”—(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer,
vol. ii. p. 93.)</p>

<p>“Each god has his favorite animal, which is dedicated to him, and
serves him as messenger.”—(“Fetichism,” Baudin, p. 68.)</p>

<p>To write what may be designated the hagiology of animal life, as
known to the ancients, would be impossible. Our knowledge is too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
fragmentary and too confused, from the inextricable blending of the
ideas of different races and cults, due to the conquests by and the
subversion of the Roman empire, when victor and vanquished reciprocally
exchanged gods, or added to the attributes of the victorious
deities those of the defeated.</p>

<p>Religion, in the last years of the Roman empire, was a kaleidoscopic
jumble of the tenets and rituals of many races, adopting without
caring to fully understand, whatever struck the fancy in the religion
of their neighbors.</p>

<p>Hence it is impossible to demonstrate, what at first sight seemed to
be an easy task, that the excreta of any particular animal was applied
in the treatment of the diseases over which the god to whom the animal
was assigned stood guard. We are not absolutely without light
upon the subject,—just enough to discover that no animal was insignificant
enough to be absolutely without adoration, but not sufficiently
clear to define exactly what functions each quadruped or bird god
exercised.</p>

<p>“The representation of the devil in the shape of a he-goat goes back
to a remote antiquity. What can have given it such a vigorous
growth among heretics and witches? The witches all imagine their
master as a black he-goat, to whom, at festival-gatherings, they pay
divine honors; conversely, the white goat atoned for and defeated
diabolic influence.... In oaths and curses of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, the he-goat apes the true god.” (Grimm, “Teutonic
Mythology,” vol. iii. p. 395.) “The devil, in retiring, is compelled
unawares to let his foot be seen.” (Idem, p. 994.) “A kobold
(horse-sprite) is also horse-footed.... To the water-sprite, the whole
or half of a horse’s figure is attributed.... That is why horses are
sacrificed to rivers.... A British demon, Grant, ... shewed himself
as a foal.... Loki changed himself into a mare.... The
devil appears as a horse in the stories of Zeno and Brother Rausch....
In legends, black steeds fetch away the damned.... Next to
the goat, ... the boar is a devil’s animal.” (Idem, pp. 994-996.)
“A soul-snatching wolf, the devil was already to the fathers.” (Idem,
p. 996.) “A canine conformation of the devil is supported by many
authorities.” (Idem, p. 996.) “Foremost among birds comes the
raven, whose form the devil is fond of assuming.” (Idem, p. 997.)
“Within the last few centuries only I find the vulture put for the
devil.... Still more frequently the cuckoo.” (Idem, p. 997.)
“Another bird whose figure is assumed is the cock.” (Idem, p. 997),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
“When stag-beetles and dung-beetles are taken as devils, ... it gives
assurance of a heathen point of view.”—(p. 999.)</p>

<p>“In Norway, lambs and kids, mostly black ones, were offered to the
water-sprite.”—(Idem, p. 1009.)</p>

<p>“It is a natural and well-known fact, that the gods of one nation
become the devils of their conquerors or successors.”—(Black, “Folk-Medicine,”
p. 12.)</p>

<p>Gladiators wore camel’s dung as a charm; it is not at all unlikely
that to the Bedouin nomad the “ship of the desert” was the god of
fortitude.</p>

<p>Fosbroke says that it was the “symbol of Arabia.”—(“Antiquities,”
p. 1011.)</p>

<p>The sacredness of the domestic cattle in India and elsewhere is too
well known to require remark; so is that of the crocodile in parts of
ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>The hare was sacred in China, and is as sacred to-day to certain
tribes of American Indians as it was to the Britons when Boadicea
drew one from her bosom to consult as an omen before joining battle
with the Roman legions.</p>

<p>The rabbit and hare figured upon ancient Spanish coins.—(Fosbroke,
“Antiquities,” vol. ii. p. 1022.)</p>

<p>The dung of hawks, eagles, and vultures was administered to expel
the fœtus from the womb. This may have been on the principle of
<i>similia similibus</i>, because these rapacious birds tore the young of other
birds from their nests and devoured them. However, the eagle was
worshipped by the Romans, Persians, and Babylonians, upon whose
standards it perched.—(See Fosbroke, “Antiquities,” vol. ii. pp. 1024,
1025, article “Eagle.”)</p>

<p>“It was the common symbol of Jupiter.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>The cat was a moon-goddess symbol to the Egyptians, as well as to
many others.—(Idem, p. 1011.)</p>

<p>The dog was sacred to Mercury as being the protector of shepherds.—(Idem,
p. 1012.)</p>

<p>The dove, as well known, was one of the symbols of Venus.</p>

<p>The dove was also worshipped by the Assyrians.—(Idem, p. 1024.)</p>

<p>The stork “accompanies filial piety ... upon coins.”—(Idem,
vol. i. p. 215.)</p>

<p>The swallow was the emblem of Isis.—(Idem, p. 216.)</p>

<p>The ancient Britons, the English down to modern days, the ancient
Romans, the Hungarians, the Scotch, and many other nations, drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
omens from the crossing of a man’s path by a hare. It is related of
Queen Boadicea that before joining battle with the Romans she drew
from her bosom a hare, which she released, and from its gambols the
priests drew the augury that success was to rest with her.—(See
in Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. pp. 201 <i>et seq.</i>, article
“Hare, Wolf, or Sow.”)</p>

<p>Says Plinius: “There must be something in the general persuasion
that after seeing a hare a man is good-looking for nine days.”—(“Saxon
Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 14.)</p>

<p>“The sun was represented by the Persians under the form of a lion,
which they called Mithra; and his priests were called lions, and the
priestesses hyenas.”—(Fosbroke, “Antiquities,” vol. ii. p. 1020.)</p>

<p>The hyena, according to Pliny, was an especially “magic” animal.—(Lib.
xxviii.)</p>

<p>The ape was “worshipped in Egypt, and is now in India.”—(Fosbroke,
“Antiquities,” vol. ii. p. 1008.)</p>

<p>“The Greeks of Pythsecusa worshipped this animal” (monkey).—(Idem,
p. 1020.)</p>

<p>The wolf. “The Hebrews venerated this animal.”—(Idem,
p. 1023.)</p>

<p>The wolf was “consecrated to Apollo.”—(Idem.)</p>

<p>The ancient belief all over Europe was that it was lucky to have
one’s path crossed by a wolf. This corresponds to the idea of the
Apache in regard to the bear.—(See Brand, “Popular Antiquities,”
vol. iii. p. 202, article “Hare, Wolf, or Sow.”)</p>

<p>The Irish veneration for the wolf is well known.</p>

<p>The lynx “accompanied Bacchus.”—(Fosbroke, “Antiquities,”
vol. ii. p. 1020.)</p>

<p>The pig was “sacrificed in the Eleusinian mysteries.”—(Idem,
p. 1021.)</p>

<p>The cow, among the Egyptians, “was the symbol of Venus.”—(Idem,
p. 1011.)</p>

<p>The elephant was “peculiar to the cars of Bacchus.”—(Idem,
p. 1014.)</p>

<p>The goat. “Maimonides says ... that the Zabii worshipped
demons under the figure of goats.”—(Idem, vol. ii. p. 1015.)</p>

<p>“Steeds were consecrated to the sun.”—(Idem, p. 1016.)</p>

<p>The crow, “anciently the symbol of Venus,” was “superseded by
the owl.”—(Idem, p. 1024.)</p>

<p>The cock was “the symbol of courage, ... consecrated to Mars;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
also to Minerva, to Bellona, to Mercury, to Esculapius.”—(Idem,
p. 1029.)</p>

<p>A flock of geese was kept on the Capitoline Hill in memory of the
story that they had saved Rome,—a story which it is safe to say had
no foundation in fact.</p>

<p>The raven “was the ensign of the Danes.”—(Idem, p. 1030.)</p>

<p>“So revered is he (the fox) that no place in a Mantchurian temple
is too high for him.”—(H. E. M. James, “The Long White Mountain,”
London, 1888, p. 190.)</p>

<p>“The serpent also is greatly feared and worshipped; so is the hare.”—(Idem,
p. 192.)</p>

<p>The peacock was sacred to Juno, whose car was drawn by those
birds. Pliny says that the peacock was reported to swallow its own
excrement, as if envying man the possession of a treasure so precious.
When the dung of the peacock was administered in epilepsy, vertigo,
etc., the medicine was to be taken from the new moon to the full.
Juno was a lunar deity.</p>

<p>“It was an ancient and wide-spread custom in Europe to bestow
names of honor on these three” (bear, wolf, and fox).—(Grimm,
“Teutonic Mythology,” vol. ii. p. 667.)</p>

<p>“The Gypsies call the bear ‘vieux,’ or ‘grand-père.’”—(Idem,
foot-note, quoting Victor Hugo’s “Notre Dame de Paris.”)</p>

<p>The blood of a hare was regarded as one of the finest remedies for
erysipelas and bloody flux, and this by a certain “sympathetic power.”
A towel dipped in hare’s blood and allowed to dry was kept to be
touched to an epileptic patient.—(See Von Helmont, “Orotrika,”
English translation, London, 1662, pp. 114, 475.)</p>

<p>The Ostaiks of Siberia “regardent comme sacré l’arbre où un aigle
a fait sa ponte plusieurs années de suite; et ils ont aussi beaucoup
d’égards pour cette aigle. On ne peut les offenser plus cruellement
qu’en tuant cette aigle ou en détruisant son nid.”—(“Voyages de
Pallas,” vol. iv. pp. 81, 82.)</p>

<p>The very name of owl (<i>googue</i>) was considered unlucky by the
Abyssinians for use as the watchword, although we are told that it
was so used.—(See Bruce, “Nile,” vol. iv. p. 698.)</p>

<p>That a belief in the sinister character of the hooting of the owl by
night prevailed all over Europe, especially among the Romans, in the
period of their greatest civilization, and that this credulity was transmitted
down almost to our own times, see in Brand, “Popular
Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 206 <i>et seq.</i>, article “Owl.” He quotes from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
Suetonius, Pliny, Ovid, Lucan, Claudia, and from various old English
authors,—“The cryinge of the owle by night betokeneth deathe, as
divinours conjecte and deme,” and</p>

<p>In Egypt, “it is said that in whatever house a cat died all the
family shaved the eyebrows.”—(Idem, vol. iii. p. 38, article
“Sorcery.”)</p>

<p>“In the earliest period the horse seems to have been the favorite
animal for sacrifice.”—(“Teut. Mythol.,” Grimm, vol. i. p. 47.)</p>

<p>The crow was always a bird of bad omen among the Romans.—(See
Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 213, article “The
Crow.”)</p>

<p>Roman magicians asserted “that the heart of a horned owl applied
to the left breast of a woman, while asleep, will make her disclose all
her secret thoughts.... Persons who have it about them in battle
will be sure to display valor;” but “it was ominous to see the bird
itself.”—(Pliny, lib. xxix, c. 26.)</p>

<p>The crocodile seems to take in Borneo the place occupied so generally
elsewhere by the serpent; although we know that in Central
America the alligator was revered, and along the Nile in many districts
the crocodile.—(See Bock’s “Head-Hunters of Borneo,” London,
1881, passim.)</p>

<p>“The hare, which shares with the cat the reputation of being the
familiar of witches, has naturally some virtues attributed to it. Thus
that the right forefoot worn in the pocket will infallibly ward off rheumatism
is a common belief in Northamptonshire, and generally over
England.” (“Folk-Medicine,” Black, p. 154.) The Chinese say that
a hare sits at the foot of the cassia-tree in the moon pounding out
the drugs of which the elixir of immortality is compounded. In a poem
of Tu-fu, a bard of the T’ang dynasty, the fame of this hare is
sung,—</p>

<p>“The devil’s mark was said to sometimes resemble the impression of
a hare’s foot.... Seeing a hare was thought in Ireland to produce a
hare-lip in the child to be born; and, as a charm, the woman who
unfortunately saw the hare was recommended to make a small rent
immediately in some part of her dress.”—(Idem, p. 155.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span></p>

<p>“It is held extremely unlucky, says Grose, to kill a cricket, a ladybug,
a swallow, martin, robin red-breast, or wren,—perhaps from the idea of
its being a breach of hospitality, all these birds and insects alike taking
refuge in our houses.... Persons killing any of the above-mentioned
birds or insects, or destroying their nests, will infallibly, within the course
of the year, break a bone, or meet with some other dreadful misfortune....
On the contrary, it was deemed lucky to have martins or swallows
build their nests in the eaves of a house or in the chimneys....
Its being accounted unlucky to destroy swallows is probably a pagan
relic. We read in Ælian that these birds were sacred to the penates
or household gods of the ancients, and therefore were preserved. They
were honored anciently as the nuncios of the spring. The Rhodians
are said to have had a solemn anniversary song to welcome in the
swallow. Anacreon’s ode to that bird is well known.” Brand also
alludes to the still surviving omens attaching to the swallow,—such
as “the swallow falling down the chimney,” and others.—(“Popular
Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 193.)</p>

<h3>THE SPANISH-AMERICAN SPORT OF “CORRER EL GALLO” AND THE ENGLISH
PASTIME OF “THROWING AT ‘SHROVE-COCKS.’”</h3>

<p>The Spaniards brought with them to the New World a cruel form of
sport, which consisted in burying a cock or hen in the earth up to its
neck, and then allowing the young men of the village to mount their
horses, and charging down at full speed upon the hapless bird, reach
down from their saddles and endeavor to seize it and wring its neck.
This sport (as seen by the author in the Indian Pueblo of Santo Domingo,
New Mexico, in 1881, and described by him in “The Snake
Dance of the Moquis”) is evidently a distorted form of the sacrifice of
the chicken deity, which is to be discovered in many parts of Europe,
always under the guise of brutal sport.</p>

<p>In England there was a modification. A goose was hung up by the
feet, and then the villagers ran and attempted to seize its head, which
was finally pulled off. There was still another of the same series in
which a cat was put in a barrel, and the barrel was then beaten to
pieces.—(See Brand, “Popular Antiquities,” vol. iii. p. 40, article
“Sorcery.”)</p>

<p>There was another English pastime, “Throwing at Shrove-Cocks,”
much of the same nature.—(See idem, vol. i. p. 101, article “Ash-Wednesday,”
and p. 72, article “Shrove-Tuesday.”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span></p>

<p>Grimm describes the “heathen custom of tying cocks to the tops
of holy-trees,” which prevailed very generally over Europe in Pagan
times. “The Wends erected cross-trees, but still secretly heathen at
heart, they contrived to fix at the very top of the poles a weather-cock.”—(Grimm,
“Teutonic Mythology,” London, vol. ii. p. 672.)</p>

<p>“In parts of Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Picardy, the reapers
place a live cock in the corn which is to be cut last, and chase it over
the field, or bury it up to the neck in the ground; afterwards they
strike off its neck with a sickle or a scythe.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, vol. ii. p. 9. He gives still other examples from Westphalia,
Transylvania, etc.)</p>

<p>See also Grose, “Dictionary of Buckish Slang,” London, 1811, article
“Goose Riding,” in which it is stated that this game was practised
“in Derbyshire within the memory of persons now living.”</p>

<h3>THE SCARABÆUS OF EGYPT.</h3>

<p>The radical divergence of opinion among scholars as to the basis of
the veneration accorded by the inhabitants of the Nile delta to the
scarabæus has been an occasion of much perplexity; no two authors
can be found to agree upon the subject.</p>

<p>In the absence of anything which can be considered conclusive, it is
not worth while to more than allude to the fact that it was the dung-beetle
to which this adoration was manifested, and possibly because it
associated itself with material so intimately connected with the living
organism.</p>

<p>The dung-beetle “scarabæus ... worn as an amulet for the cure
of fever.”—(Pliny, lib. xxx. cap. 30.)</p>

<p>See also “Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 16, in which the preceding
paragraph from Pliny is quoted.</p>

<p>“To the Egyptians the beetle (scarabæus) was sacred, being an
emblem of inmost life and mysterious self-generation. They believed
that he proceeded out of matter which he rolled into globules and
buried in manure.”—(Grimm, “Teut. Mythol.,” vol. ii. p. 692.)</p>

<p>“The Thebaic beetle, the first animal that is seen alive after the
Nile retires from the land.” Bruce thinks that the scarabæus was
the symbol of “the land which had been overflowed and from which
the water had soon retired, and has nothing to do with the resurrection
or immortality, neither of which were at that time in contemplation.”—(“Nile,”
Bruce, Dublin, 1790, vol. i. p. 129.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span></p>

<p>Sir Samuel Baker says: “It appears shortly after the commencement
of the wet season, its labors continuing until the cessation of the
rains, at which time it disappears. Was it not worshipped by the
ancients as the harbinger of the high Nile?”—(“The Albert Nyanza,”
pp. 240, 241.)</p>

<p>“On sait que l’escarbot ou fouille-merde, qui nait dedans et qui s’en
nourrit, était pour les Égyptiens l’image du monde, du soleil, d’Isis,
d’Osiris.”—(“Bib. Scat.,” pp. 1 and 2, quoting Pliny, lib. xxx. cap. 11;
lib. ii. cap. 30; Kircher, Prodrom. Egypt. cap. ult.)</p>

<p>The beetle was not killed by the peasantry of Ireland, according to
Lady Wilde. See her book, page 175.</p>

<p>Scholars will understand that the remarks submitted upon the veneration
attaching to all these animals have been introduced merely as
aids to memory in the consideration of this matter, and not as completely
covering all that could be advanced on the subject.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PERSISTENCE OF FILTH REMEDIES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Another feature deserving of attention is the persistence with
which the same remedies have been perpetuated through the centuries;
from Hippocrates, perhaps, certainly from Pliny to Sextus
Placitus, then to “Saxon Leechdoms,” and thence to the authorities
prepared immediately after the discovery of printing, there is a transmittal
of the same prescriptions for the same diseases.</p>

<p>Avicenna, the Arabian, has unmistakably drawn the inspiration of
his knowledge from the broken fountains of Latin-Christian civilization.</p>

<h3>EPILEPSY.</h3>

<p>The dung of the peacock was one of the favorite prescriptions for
the alleviation of epilepsy, the disease so pre-eminently of divine origin
that by the Romans it was termed the Divine Disease<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> (Morbus sacer).</p>

<p>Epilepsy was likewise called the “comitial disease,” because, according
to the different authorities consulted upon the subject, the moment
a Roman was attacked by it, the “comitia,” if in session, were dissolved.
The “comitia ... were the assemblies of the clans for deliberating
upon such important matters as the appointment of judges,
etc.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Of exactly what transpired afterwards we have no knowledge; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
is most likely that the assembled clans devoted themselves to supplicating
the gods to take mercy upon an afflicted kinsman. It is not at all
beyond the limits of probability that the patient was, in early days,
sacrificed to appease the wrath of the deity inflicting the punishment,
or disease as we should designate it. This, at least, is the only rational
inference to be drawn from the action taken with the clothing worn
during the fit, and the excrement voided at the same time, both of
which, as we have seen, were burned,—a reminiscence of the earlier
practice when such a fate was meted out to the victim himself.</p>

<p>But we do find that the belief in transference or transplantation was
one of the underlying principles of all medical practice in ancient and
mediæval times; and, by a reference to the examples cited, it will be
noted that special stress was laid upon the employment of clippings of
the hair or nails of the patient, or his urine, ordure, or, in rarer instances,
his saliva or perspiration; these were to be placed in egg-shells
and then buried in ant-hills, thrown into fish-ponds, given to dogs or
chickens, or thrown out in the cross-roads, in the hope that some traveller,
impelled by curiosity, would pick up the strange package and
with it take the disease from the original sufferer.</p>

<p>All diseases were believed to be punishments inflicted by angry
gods; therefore, all medicines were originally charms, i. e. oblations or
sacrifices to propitiate the offended spirits or to secure the interposition
of still more powerful gods who should render nugatory the malevolent
work of the minor. Sometimes, the charms employed suggest unmistakably
the prior existence of human sacrifice; the trembling victim
was ordered to sacrifice himself or one of his household. But, on the
principle that the part represents the whole, in other words, that the
actual sacrifice could be deferred in consideration of the presentation
of a pledge, such a pledge was offered in the shape of hair, nails, skin,
blood, excrements, saliva, or shreds of the clothing belonging to the
interested devotee, the supposition, of course, being that the propitiated
Deity could, at a future time, insist upon the execution of the
contract, or the consummation of the sacrifice the pledge guaranteed.</p>

<p>Therefore, when we find in “sympathetic” cures, that human
exuviæ, excrements, etc., are thrown into ponds, we may without difficulty
infer that the fishes or water gods, in accepting the oblation,
accepted the sacrifice as symbolized, and, being appeased, took back to
themselves the disease they had in their wrath inflicted.</p>

<p>The same is the underlying principle when such “charms,” as we
very properly call them, were hung upon trees, or stones, or around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
holy wells; it was the guardian spirits of those localities which had
been offended and must be mollified by the “carmen” or ode of incantation
which was an inseparable adjunct of all such votive offerings,—from
which comes our own word “charm.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>When the “charm” was thrown to a dog, or placed in a field, where
cattle, horses, or sheep, or wild beasts might pasture upon it, an animal
god had to be propitiated; and where it was simply thrown out
on the road, or, better still, at a cross-roads, the “earth-spirits,” or
some goblins not definitely determined upon, in the mind of the sacrificer,
were believed to be the authors of his infirmity.</p>

<p>Hanging these charms up in the chimney of one’s own house was
clearly an invocation to clan or family spirits to withdraw their wrath
from an afflicted kinsman, or hasten to his assistance. Viewed in this
light, the “charms” that to us seem so trivial, the rags, tufts of hair,
etc., may, in the mind of the person offering them, have been oblations
of the most sacred character.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY HUMAN ORDURE AND HUMAN URINE WERE
EMPLOYED IN MEDICINE AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>ANCESTOR-WORSHIP.—MAN-WORSHIP.—THE GRAND LAMA.</h3>

<p>“Homo est medicus, et ex homine medicina paratur,” said Flemming,
in his “De Remediis ex corpore humano desumtis,” that
is to say, man being a doctor, from man medicine is prepared.</p>

<p>The savage, with all his fear of the vague and indefinable, had still
a wonderful belief in himself as the greatest of nature’s works; all his
great gods he created in his own image and likeness; he went even
further, and ascribed to the priests or representatives of the gods, the
same respect and veneration as were supposed to be due to the gods
themselves; hence arose man-worship, still existing in Thibet in its
most pronounced form, and surviving in Europe down to the present
generation almost, in the modification known as “touching for the
king’s evil,” which touching derived its efficacy from the double belief
that all ailments were sent from some supernatural, and, generally,
maleficent, source, and could, therefore, best be cured by the imposition
of the hands of an individual whom the inunction of a little consecrated
fat had bound more closely to the Omnipotent.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>This belief cropped out in charms and talismans, which were nothing
more nor less than medicines to avert bad luck and remedy disease,
itself a manifestation of bad luck; or, to express the idea still
more clearly, medicines themselves were nothing but charms originally,
in the application of which our forefathers paid less attention to pharmaceutical
properties than they did to those of an occult or “sympathetic”
nature which their own ignorance attributed to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span></p>

<p>Animals and plants and stones, being objects of worship, were naturally
enough called upon to furnish remedies for all ailments, and palliatives
for every misfortune. The grandest animal of all, man, could
not well be omitted from the Materia Medica; every thing that pertains
to either sex, either in structure or in function, must have impressed
the untutored mind with a sense of awe; all excretions, solid
or fluid, were invested with mystic properties, and called into requisition
upon occasions of special import.</p>

<p>On the subject of man-worship, consult Frazer, “The Golden Bough,”
vol. i. c. 2, pp. 8, 9.</p>

<p>“Among the negroes, royalty is deified; kings are supposed to be
of the race of gods, and, after death, become demi-gods.”—(“Fetichism,”
Baudin, p. 24.)</p>

<p>Saliva, the ordure, urine, catamenial fluid, blood, bile, calculi, bones,
skulls,—all were mysterious, and therefore were “medicine,” especially
when obtained from a saint or lama.</p>

<p>This belief subsisted among tribes and communities long after civilization
of a high type had been attained, and is probably what Saint
Mark alludes to in an ambiguous passage, when he says, “It is not the
things which enter a man’s body, but those which come out of it,
which defile him.”</p>

<p>Again, it is not from the bodies of the living alone, but from the
corpses of the dead likewise, that medicinal preparations were derived;
but in the latter case there enters into the question another expression
of thought, shared by primitive man in all countries and in all ages;
i. e., that the part is ever the representative of the whole, and that
when the whole cannot be obtained, the part will be equally efficacious.
Hence the precious care with which, in all communities in a
low state of culture, the bones, teeth, rags of clothing, and other
exuviæ of the sacred dead have been treasured.</p>

<span class="smaller">EASTER EGGS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The constant use of the egg in effecting these cures by transplantation
awakens a suspicion that the origin of the pretty custom
of giving away Easter eggs, beautifully colored, was induced by something
more than charitable impulse. Nearly every usage that remains
among us as a game or a play derives from a serious ancestry. Easter
was pre-eminently the festival of the Christian church which most
tenaciously preserved the rites of paganism. It was, for some reason,
looked upon as the season when the human body, as well as the house
occupied by that body, should undergo a thorough cleansing, and get
rid of all its ailments. The coloring of the eggs suggests color-symbolism,
an essentially heathen idea, still retained among ourselves in
full vigor, under many Protean disguises.</p>

<p>When the Puritans gained control of the government of Great
Britain, the coloring of eggs, as we may imagine, was temporarily discontinued.
The “picking” of the eggs is a survival from one of the
innumerable forms of divination by lot in which the pagan mind of
Rome and elsewhere delighted.</p>

<p>Therefore we may reasonably conclude that the custom, as transmitted
to us, is a “survival” from a religious usage intended to effect
the transference by lot of the diseases with which the egg-players were
afflicted.</p>

<p>“The oldest, most familiar, and most universal of all Easter customs
are those associated with eggs. Hundreds of years before Christ,
eggs held an important place in the theology and philosophy of the
Egyptians, Persians, Gauls, Greeks, and Romans, among all of whom
an egg was the emblem of the universe, and the art of coloring it was
profoundly studied. The sight of street boys striking their eggs together
to see which is the stronger and shall win the other, was as
common in the streets of Rome and Athens, two thousand years ago,
if we are to believe antiquarians, as it is in any of our American cities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
to-day. These eggs, now called Easter eggs, were originally known as
Pasche eggs, corrupted to paste eggs, because connected with the
Paschal or Passover feast. One reason for associating the egg with
the day on which our Saviour rose from the dead may be, that the
little chicks entombed, so to speak, in the egg, rising from it into life,
was regarded as typical of an ascension from the grave.</p>

<p>“In the north of England it is customary to exchange presents of
Easter eggs among the children of families who are on intimate terms,
a custom which also prevailed largely among the ancients, and to
which the sending of Easter cards and other offerings, which has
become so popular here of late years, may be traced.”—(From the
“Press,” Philadelphia, Penn., April 21, 1889.)</p>

<p>“Thirty years ago, it was a common practice for all elderly people
to be bled or cupped each spring.”—(“Folk-Medicine of the Pennsylvania
Germans,” Hoffman, in Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1889.)</p>

<p>“To hang an egg laid on Ascension Day in the roof of the house,
preserveth the same from all hurt.”—(Scot, “Discoverie,” p. 193.)</p>

<p>“The modern custom, practised in Tripoli, of a widow transferring
her misfortunes from herself by delivering four eggs to the first stranger
she meets.”—(Dalyell, “Superstitions of Scotland,” p. 110.)</p>

<p>“It comes to be thought desirable to have a general riddance of
evil spirits at fixed times, usually once a year, in order that the people
may make a fresh start in life, freed from all the malign influences
which have been long accumulating among them.”—(“The Golden
Bough,” Frazer, vol. ii. p. 163.)</p>

<p>“Modern Jews sacrifice a white cock on the eve of the Festival of
Expiation, nine days after the beginning of their new year. The
father of the family knocks the cock thrice against his own head,
saying, ‘Let this cock be a substitute for me,’ etc.”—(Idem, vol. ii.
p. 195.)</p>

<p>The negroes of Guinea seem to entertain notions on this subject
worthy of incorporation in this chapter: “The sending of the parrot’s
egg signifies, Choose the kind of death which would be easiest to you;
otherwise, we will choose for you.”—(“Fetichism,” Baudin, p. 23.)</p>

<p>In many portions of Europe there are still in existence rustic observances
which, under the mask of games, preserve to the mind of the
anthropologist the former rite of human sacrifice. Among these may
be mentioned one from Sweden, in which a boy—who in the past
ages was evidently the victim selected for sacrifice, and to bear to the
gods the messages of the community,—goes about from house to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
house, carrying a basket, in which he collects gifts of eggs and the like.
(Frazer, “The Golden Bough,” vol. i. p. 78.) It seems to be logical
to imagine that these gifts, sent to the deities to propitiate them, also
served the purpose of carrying away from the donors any ailments
with which they were afflicted,—the same purpose for which Easter
eggs were broken, and the transfer of illness brought about by lot.
The insignificance of the egg as an offering, in comparison with the
benefits to be expected, offers no argument in rebuttal of the opinions
just expressed. We should bear in mind the proneness of the devotee
to reduce the money value of his sacrifice or oblations to the minimum.
This is peculiar to no cultus, confined to no latitude. The worship of
the chicken-god was apparently very widely ramified, especially among
the divisions and subdivisions of what we have chosen to call the Aryan
family. To several of these branches, notably the Wendish and the
Celtic, the chicken was, perhaps, the principal god; and he remains
to this day in his proud position, whence the first missionaries were
unable to dislodge him, at the summit of the sacred tree or spire of
the village church.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, what we should expect to see upon the recurrence
among these tribes of a festival in which their principal spiritual
powers were to be invoked to expel all forms of disease and evil from
among their worshippers, would be the sacrifice of chickens; but the
poverty or the niggardliness of the suppliant in many cases suggested
a substitution of the cheaper offering, the egg, which may, in its turn,
have been replaced by the feathers of the bird.</p>

<p>In parts of India, to this day, the scapegoat of the community is a
cock. “In southern Konkan, on the appearance of cholera, the villagers
went in procession from the temple to the extreme boundaries
of the village, carrying a basket of cooked rice, covered with red
powder, a wooden doll, representing the pestilence, and a cock. The
head of the cock was cut off at the village boundary, and the body
was thrown away. When cholera was thus transferred from one village
to another, the second village observed the same ceremony, and
passed the scourge on to its neighbors.”—(“The Golden Bough,”
Frazer, vol. ii. p. 191.)</p>

<p>“When spring comes,” said Pantagruel to Panurge, “I will take
a purge.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE USE OF BLADDERS IN MAKING EXCREMENT SAUSAGES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It was believed to be peculiarly necessary that the urine or ordure of
those suffering from epilepsy, yellow jaundice, quartan fevers, etc.,
should be placed in a pig’s bladder, and hung up in the chimney; in
other words, they were made into an excrement sausage.</p>

<p>Traces of the employment of these sausages appear from the most
remote times. Galen has a paragraph which reads as if he had some
such practice in mind. Speaking of human ordure, he says: “Utitur
non modo medicamenti quæ focis imponuntur commiscens, sed iis quoque
quæ intro in os sumuntur.” It would seem that he was alluding
to mixtures in domestic medicine when some such preparations were
placed on the hearths (focis).</p>

<p>For the potency of these excrement sausages in rescuing victims
from the clutches of witches, from the yellow jaundice, from fevers,
and other troubles we have the assurances of such grave and reputable
writers as Schurig, Paullini, Etmuller, Frommann, and others of ages
past; while Black certifies to their use in Staffordshire; and Hoffman
tells us of customs among the Germans of Pennsylvania which are distinctly
and undeniably modifications of those transmitted from the
mother-country. Reference to the words of these authorities, as
herein quoted, is recommended; among them the following may be
found worthy of remark.</p>

<p>“The entrails will be affected with corrosion when hot excrement
is placed in a bladder.”—(Frommann, p. 1023.)</p>

<p>Schurig instances a farmer who by hanging up in his chimney the
dung of his neighbor’s horses drove them all into a consumption.—(“Chylologia,”
p. 815.)</p>

<p>In the Island of Nukahiva the witch wasn’t content with getting
the excrement of the victim; it had to be put in a “bag woven in a
particular manner,” and buried.—(Krusenstern.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span></p>

<p>The devil cannot be more completely frustrated than by placing
upon some of his works human ordure, or by hanging human ordure
in the smoke of the chimney.—(Paullini, p. 260.)</p>

<p>“A certain man bewitched a boy nine years old by placing the boy’s
ordure in a hog’s bladder and hanging the sausage in a chimney.”—(Idem,
p. 261.)</p>

<p>In Staffordshire, to cure the yellow jaundice, a bladder was often
filled with the urine of the patient and placed near the fire. (Black,
“Folk-Medicine.”) It is strange to encounter among the Australians
the very same ideas, expressed in identical terms, in regard to effecting
enchantments by means of the victim’s ordure, wrapped in a roll or
bundle not altogether unlike the sausages of European occult art.</p>

<p>“Should a Bangal in the course of his wanderings drop across an old
encampment of Bukeens, he searches about for some débris (such as
bones) of the food they have eaten; but should his search for bones or
some other kindred débris be unsuccessful, as frequently happens (from
the fact of its being a habit common to all the aboriginal tribes to
consume by fire the bones of the game upon which they have fed before
they abandon a camp), he anxiously scans the ground all round
the abandoned camp for feculent excrement; and should any of the
Bukeens, from laziness or other cause, have omitted to use his paddle,
or to have used it carelessly, the vigilant Bangal pounces upon the unhidden
feces as a miser would upon a treasure.</p>

<p>“After he has secured his savory find, he lubricates a piece of opossum-skin
with the kidney-fat of some of his victims, and carefully
wraps it round his treasure, after which yards of twine are wound
round and round, each wind being what sailors term a ‘half-hitch.’ ...
At night, when all in camp are quiet, the Bangal carefully takes
his prize from the bag, beginning a low, monotonous chant, while he
thrusts one end of the prepared roll into the fire (the fire is small by
design); during the process of gradual combustion the chant is continued....
Should it be his wish to kill the Bukeen outright in
one night, he keeps up the chant, and pushes the burning roll forward
into the glowing embers as it consumes, and when the last vestige of
it has dispersed in unsavory smoke the life of the Bangal’s victim
has ceased.... Should the Bangal, however, wish to prolong the
dying agonies of his foe, he merely burns a small portion of the roll
nightly, chanting his incantation during the process, and should months
pass before the roll is totally consumed so long will the torture of his
victim continue.”—(“The Aborig. of Vict. and Riverina,” Beveridge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
Adelaide, 1889, p. 169, received through the kindness of the Royal
Society, Sydney, New South Wales, F. B. Kyngdon, secretary.)</p>

<p>“In Thuringia a sausage is stuck in the last sheaf at threshing, and
thrown with the sheaf on the threshing-floor. It is called the “barrenwurst,”
and is eaten by all the threshers. After they have eaten
it, a man is encased in pease straw, and thus attired is led through
the village.”—(“The Golden Bough,” Frazer, vol. i. p. 371.)</p>

<p>Attaching to this array of facts the value which properly belongs to
each and every one of them, and no more, it seems that the Feast of
Fools may be better understood by regarding it as the burlesque and
distorted “survival” of a sacred, comitial gathering of the gens or
community, in which the excrement sausage served a now completely
forgotten purpose in eliminating from the people the baleful curse
of witchcraft, epilepsy, jaundice, fevers, and other disorders which
would not yield promptly to the simple medicaments of primitive
therapeutics.</p>

</div>

<p>Lastly, it may be urged that the thoughtful consideration of this
subject will not be without results of importance to science. It
shows us, if we may employ a mathematical expression, that by integrating
the equation of man’s development between the limits zero, in
which these disgusting practices had full sway, and the limit of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1891, the precise extent of his advancement in all that we call civilization
can better be understood.</p>

<p>The biologist and psychologist may find material to demonstrate to
what extent primitive man, in corresponding environment in different
regions of the world, will display the same instincts and act under
identical impulses.</p>

<p>The student of comparative mythology will certainly discover much
to interest and instruct him.</p>

<p>The student of folk-lore should find here a field promising the most
prolific results. Folk-usage, especially in folk-medicine,—which is
simply the crystallization of the mythology and religious medicine of the
most primitive ages,—should respond most generously to any demands
that may be made upon this and other points which the
ordinary writer believes to be too unclean for his pen.</p>

<p>To the author it has been a work involving apparently endless research,
much of it barren of result, and a correspondence with scholars
in all countries, whose contributions have been of the first importance
in determining that the filthy rite of urine-drinking as seen among the
Zuñis of the United States was paralleled by the orgies of other savages,
and had its counterparts and imitations in the “survivals,” often
distorted into burlesque, of nations of high enlightenment.</p>

<p>Verily, it may be said in concluding, as in beginning this volume,
the proper study of mankind is man; the study of man is the study of
man’s religion.</p>

“However disgusting the subject may appear to such readers who do not consider it
in the light of science, the article is a fair specimen of the maxim that, for a scientific
mind, nothing is too abject or insignificant for consideration; and it also
illustrates the other principle, that to the pure everything is pure. Many of the
rites described in these pages show how deeply engraved in the human mind is the
tendency of symbolizing, anthromorphizing, and deifying abstract ideas and phenomena
of nature.”—(Extract from review by Dr. Alfred Gatchett, Bureau of Ethnology,

American and Britannic Encyclopædias. Lemprière defines Cloacina: “A goddess
of Rome, who presided over the Cloacæ—some suppose her to be Venus—whose
statue was found in the Cloacæ, whence the name.”—(See, also, in Anthon’s

que son los lugares donde van á parar todas las suciedades, inmundicias, y vascosidades
de una Republica.”—(Torquemada, lib. vi. chap. 17.)</p>

<p>“‘Mais si les bœufs et les lions avaient des mains,—s’ils savaient dessiner avec ces
mains, et produire les mêmes œuvres que les hommes,—ils (les dieux) seraient semblables
aux bœufs pour les bœufs et semblables aux chevaux pour les chevaux. Et
ceux-ci dessineraient les figures des dieux et ils leur feraient des corps semblables
à ceux qu’ils ont eux-mêmes.’—Patrologie Grecque de Migne, t. xxi. col. 1121,

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> L’adorateur présentait devant l’autel son postérieur nu, soulageait ses entrailles
et faisait à l’idole une offrande de sa puante déjection.—(Dulaure, “Des Divinités
Génératrices,” Paris, 1825, p. 76.)</p>

<p>Philo says the devotee of Baal-Peor presented to the idol all the outward orifices
of the body. Another authority says that the worshipper not only presented all
these to the idol, but that the emanations or excretions were also presented,—tears
from the eyes, wax from the ears, pus from the nose, saliva from the mouth, and
urine and dejecta from the lower openings. This was the god to which the Jews
joined themselves; and these, in all probability, were the ceremonies they practised
in his worship.—(Robert Allen Campbell, Phallic Worship, St. Louis, 1888, p. 171.)</p>

<p>Still another authority says the worshipper, presenting his bare posterior to the
altar, relieved his bowels, and offered the result to the idol: “Eo quod distendebant
coram illo foramen podicis et stercus offerebant.”—(Hargrave Jennings,
Phallicism, London, 1884, quoting Rabbi Solomon Jarchi, in his Commentary on
Numbers xxv.)</p>

<p>These two citations go to show that the worshipper intended making not a merely
ceremonial offering of flatulence, but an actual oblation of excrement, such as has
been stated, was placed upon the altars of their near neighbors, the Assyrians, in the
devotions tendered their Venus.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> Among the Chinese and Hindus an identical partition of responsibility will be
found ascribed to the deities. It would require a special disquisition to enumerate
these gods and their functions, so far as known to us, but such an enumeration
would do no good, because the accuracy of the statement will be admitted without
dispute.</p>

<p>A clipping from the “Times,” of India, copied in the “Sunday Herald,” of
Washington, D. C., June 2, 1889, bears upon this point:</p>

<p>“The general public are not aware of a ludicrous custom still followed in Hindu
households of Bengal. The last day of Falgoon, that fell on the 12th ultimo, was
observed in worshipping Ghantoo, the god of itches and the diseases of the skin
which afflict the natives. Very early in the morning of the day the mistresses of
the families, changing their nocturnal attire, put a useless, black earthen vessel
outside the threshold of their back doors, with a handful of rice and masoor dal,
four cowries, with a piece of rag smeared with turmeric. Wild flowers appearing
in this season are offered in worship. (These flowers are called Ghantoo fool.) The
young boys of the family stand in a semicircle before the mistress, with cudgels in
their hands. When the conches are sounded by the female worshippers, as the signal
of the poojah being over, the boys break the vessels into atoms. The mirthful
children, in their anxiety to strike the first blow, sometimes break the fingers and
hands of the matrons. The piece of rag is preserved over the doors of houses in
the zenana. In the evening of the day, the boys of the lower order of the villages
sing the songs of the occasion from door to door for pice.”</p>

<p>Although the adoration of Flatulence cannot be found among the Chinese,
religious customs equally revolting have been ascribed to them. “The Chinese
are addicted to the abominable vice of Sodomy, and the filthy practice of it they
number among the indifferent things they perform in honor of their idols.”—(“The
Travels of Two Mahomedans through India and China,” in Pinkerton,
vol. vii. p. 195.) These Mahomedans travelled in the ninth century.</p>

<p>“The negroes of Guinea have a god of the small-pox.” See “Fetichism,” by
Father P. Baudin, New York, 1885, p. 74.</p>

<p>According to the Guinea negroes, “Every man has three genii, or protecting
spirits. The first is Eleda, who dwells in the head, which he guides.... This
second genius (Ojehun) has his habitation in the region of the stomach....
Ipori, the third protecting genius, takes up his abode in the great toe.”—(Idem,
p. 43.)</p>

<p>“The Samoans supposed disease to be occasioned by the wrath of some particular
deity.... The friends of the sick went to the high priest of the village....
Each disease had its particular physician.”—(Turner, “Samoa,” London,
1884, p. 140.) See, in this connection, Banier’s “Mythology,” English translation,
vol. i. p. 196, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>“They (the ancients) had gods and goddesses for all the necessaries of our life,
from our cradles to our graves; viz., 1. for sucking; 2. for swathing; 3. for
eating; 4. for drinking; 5. for sleeping; 6. for husbandry; 7. for venery; 8. for
fighting; 9. for physic; 10. for marriage; 11. for child-bed; 12. for fire; 13. for
water; 14. for the thresholds; 15. for the chimneys.”—(Harington, “Ajax,”
p. 27.)</p>

<p>Consult, for the Chaldeans, “The Chaldean Account of Genesis,” George Smith,
New York, 1880, pages 11 and 125. Dibbara, the god of pestilence, has the title
of “The Darkening One,” which recalls the passage in Psalm xci. 6, “The pestilence
that walketh in darkness.” ... “Each of the Babylonian gods had
a particular city.” (Idem, p. 46.) “The Chaldeans had twelve great gods.”
(Idem, p. 47.) See, also, “Chaldean Magic,” Lenormant, 35. It was written of
the deceased (Egyptian), “There is not a limb of him without a god.” (“Ritual
of the Dead,” cap. xliii., idem.) See “Le Moyen Age Médical,” Dupouy, for the
list of saints and shrines to cure all afflictions, in Europe, Minor’s translation,
p. 83. Those possessed claimed to be in the power of a demon, who entered their
body by one of the natural passages, sporting with their persons. (Idem, p. 50.)
The Church recognized the truth of these beliefs (idem, p. 40); see, also, notes
taken from Turner’s “Samoa.”</p>

énorme branche phallique que présentait la statue du saint; elles croyaient que la
raclure enfusée dans un boisson, les rendrait fécondes.”</p>

<p>But Davenport, who has probed deeply into the question of phallic worship,
contends that such vestiges existed in some of the communities of France, Sicily,
and Belgium, not only down to the Reformation, but even to the opening decades
of the nineteenth century.—(See Davenport, “On the Powers of Reproduction,”

ó redecillos llenos de flor de las espadañas ó de algunos papeles rotos; ataban
estos con unos cordelejos ó cintas de media vara de largo, de tal manera que pudiese
hacer golpe; otros hacian á manera de guantes las taleguillas é hinchabanlos de lo
arriba dicho ó de ojas de maiz verde; ponian pena á todos estos que nadie echase
piedra ó cosa que pudiese lastimar dentro las taleguillos. Comenzaban luego los
muchachos á jugar este juego á manera de escaramuza y dabanse de talegazos en la
cabeza y por donde acertaban y de poco en poco se iban multiplicando de los muchachos
y los mas traviesos daban de talegazos á las muchachas que pasaban por la
calle; á las veces, se juntaban tres ó quatro para dar á una de tal manera que la
fatigaban y la hacian llorar.</p>

<p>Algunas muchachas que eran mas discretas, si habian de ir á alguna parte, entonces
llevaban un palo ú otra cosa que hiciese temer para defenderse. Algunos
muchachos escondian la talega y quando pasaba alguna mujer descuidadamente,
dabanla de talegazos y quando la daban un golpe, decian Chichiquatzinte mantze,
que quiere decir, “Madre Nuestra, és la talega de este juego.” Las mugeres andaban
muy recatadas quando ivan á alguna parte.—(Sahagun, in “Kingsborough,”

by the author of this volume. In the last it is shown that the idea in the aboriginal
mind is that each color is a medicine, and that the rainbow, being a combination
of them all, is a panacea; but it should be pointed out that, even in the days
of Dr. Joseph Lanzoni (1694) there were some bold medical scholars who openly
derided such notions as absurd and irrational.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">[97]</a> There can scarcely be a doubt that pharmacy was, in its incipiency, distinctly
and unequivocally religious in character. Grimm is full of the matter. He tells us
that “the culling and fetching of herbs had to be done at particular times and according
to long-established forms.... Shortly before sunrise when the day is
young.... The viscum was gathered at new moon, Prima Luna.... Some had
to be gathered in darkness, others plucked by the light of the moon, generally the
new moon; others by a person fasting; others before hearing thunder that year....
In digging up an herb, the Roman custom was first to pour mead and honey
round it, as if to propitiate the earth, then cut round the root with a sword, looking
towards the east (or west), and the moment it is pulled out, to lift it on high
without letting it touch the ground.... A great point was to guard against cold
iron touching the root; hence gold or red-hot iron was used in cutting.... In
picking or pulling up, the operator used the left hand in certain cases; he had to do
it unbelted and unshod, and to state for whom and for what purpose it was done.”
Grimm complains of the scantiness of German tradition on this point; yet, he finds
that the “hyoscyamus,” or henbane, had to be taken from the ground by a naked
virgin, using the little finger of the right hand and standing on the right foot. The
French formulæ for such purposes require: “Quelques uns pour se garantir de
maléfices ou de charmes vont cueillir de grand matin, à jeun, sans avoir lavé leurs
mains, sans avoir prié Dieu, sans parler à personne, et sans saluer personne en leur
chemin, une certaine plante, et la mettent ensuite sur la personne maléficiée ou
ensorcelée. Ils portent sur eux une racine de chicorée, qu’ils ont touché à genoux
avec de l’or et de l’argent le jour de la Nativité de Saint Jean Baptiste un peu avant
le soleil levé, et qu’ils ont ensuite arrachée de terre avec un ferrement et beaucoup
de cérémonies, après l’avoir exorcisée avec l’épée de Judas Machabée.” The herb
was to be “neither fretted nor squashed.” “The Romans had a strange custom of
laying a sieve in the road, and using the stalks of grass that grew up through it
for medical purposes.” (Grimm, “Teut. Mythol.” vol. iii. p. 1195 <i>et seq.</i>) He
fully describes the ceremony for gathering the mandrake, and also refers to the
mistletoe, but adds nothing to the information in these pages. In many of the
prescriptions given by Marcellus, which prescriptions were generally of a magical
character (tempus, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 380), there are injunctions to “observe chastity.”—(See
“Saxon Leechdoms,” lib. i. pp. 20, 29.)</p>

<p>Again, in “Saxon Leechdoms,” vol. i. p. 11, we learn that certain medicinal
plants were to be pulled in a prescribed manner, the name of the patient to be murmured
at the same moment (quoting from Pliny, lib. xxi., xxii.; again, idem, vol. i.
p. 14, quoting Pliny, lib. xii. c. 16.)</p>

<p>The herb mandrake could not be pulled for medicinal purposes except by a pure
man. “Its virtue is so mickle and famous that it will immediately flee from an unclean
man” (idem, vol. i. p. 245); again, in gathering the periwinkle, “when thou
shalt pluck this wort, thou shalt be free from every uncleanness” (vol. i. p. 313).</p>

<p>The belief in regard to the manner of pulling the mandrake exists among the
Turks: “The pacha told me of a curiosity to be seen at Orfa.... This curiosity
consisted of two small figures, made of a peculiar shrub, partly trained and partly
twisted and partly cut into the form of a man and woman, very rudely done, and
stained over to give them the appearance of having grown in that shape.... The
inhabitants, in order to obtain them, tied a dog by a string to each figure, and then
went a long distance off. As soon as the dog pulled the string, and drew the creature
out of the ground, the noise it made killed the dog.”—(“Assyrian Discoveries,”
George Smith, New York, 1876, p. 161.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[98]</a> Hippocrates did not believe that epilepsy was a “divine” disease, sent by the
gods; such an idea was, in his opinion, fostered by quacks for personal advantage.—(See
the edition of his work by Francis Adams, Sydenham Society, London,
1849.)</p>

<p>“Nothing could tend more to retard the progress of medicine, and paralyze all
efforts for its improvement, than the opinion, once so generally entertained, of the
celestial origin of disease, which, if admitted, appears necessarily to demand divine
interposition for its relief. Religion and medicine were both brought into contempt
by the adoption of sacrifices and incantations and the mercenary practices of the
priests to insure intercession with the gods.”—(“Medic. Superstitions,” Pettigrew,
p. 45.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Dr. Thomas G. Morton, of Philadelphia, imparts the information
that not only is the use of human urine still general among ignorant
women during pregnancy, but that it has been learned that female
abortionists have been in the habit of vending a nostrum for defeating
pregnancy, one of the components of which was the catamenial
discharge.</p>

<p class="tb">Referring to previous remarks, on <a href="#Page_162">page 162</a>, it may be noticed that a
curious instance of survival by contrariety is to be detected in what
Picart relates of the Hebrew ceremonial of the present day. He says
of the behavior of the Hebrew while praying, that he should carefully
avoid gaping, spitting, blowing his nose, or emitting any exhalations:
“Il doit éviter autant qu’il se peut de bailler, de cracher, de se
moucher, de laisser aller des vents.” (Picart, “Coutumes et Cérémonies,”
&amp;c., vol. i. p. 126). All this information seems to be taken
from the work of the Rabbi Leon, of Modena.</p>

<p>In the above are seen the antipodes of the practices characteristic of
the worship of Baal-Peor which the prophets had so much trouble in
eradicating from the minds of the chosen people.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
